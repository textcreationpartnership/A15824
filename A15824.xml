            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know if the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe as well as the heads had proceeded from the ≈øame hand, they would haue beene more accurate and perfect. A ≈øhaft ≈øhot by the hand of a Gyant, and a childe differ much; yet will I not in a fond admiration, and api≈øh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any per≈øon make all his deeds and doctrines like the reflection of a looking gla≈ø≈øe, to frame all thoughts and things by his ≈øhadow. This were but to catch Doterels, and ≈øhew feats of actiuitie, to deceiue the ≈øimple. Againe, if ≈øome little thing be cen≈øured in the fir≈øt inventor, I hope they that loue him, will not thinke, as good friends as they deale with him, like Gnatts, which after they haue made a ≈øweete kinde of Mu≈øicke, euermore ≈øting before they depart. I feare not thy profit in it, if thou will ≈øubmit both it and thy ≈øelfe to the true touch-≈øtone, I meane the ≈øacred Scriptures; otherwi≈øe with <hi>Perillus</hi> thou mayest peri≈øh in thy owne inventions, and thine owne cunning at the la≈øt will fayle thee, and leaue thee as <hi>Ab≈øolons</hi> Mule left his rebellious Ma≈øter betweene heauen and earth. Con≈øider therefore what is ≈øaid, and the Lord giue thee vnder≈øtanding in all things, that thou maye≈øt be no le≈ø≈øe wi≈øe, then good. Amen.</p>

               <p>A. All that <hi>matter</hi> which was clo≈øed and compa≈ø≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the third heauen, and was made at the ≈øame in≈øtant with it to prohibite &amp; keepe out vacuitie, or emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine≈ø≈øe, and fill vp the whole compa≈ø≈øe of it, otherwi≈øe the parts of them≈øelues would haue fallen together to haue kept out that enemy of nature. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are we to vnder≈øtand no more by earth then that fir≈øt matter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, wee are to vnder≈øtand the forming of it into the foure elements, <hi>fire, ayre, water,</hi> and <hi>earth;</hi> as likewi≈øe the filling of it and them with <hi>inhabitants,</hi> both aboue and below: as al≈øo the <hi>providence</hi> of the Father in pre≈øeruing and governing of them all to their ends and v≈øes: for the Father carries the worke according to his proper manner of working, vntill we come to Redemption, and there the Sonne takes it vpon him in a peculiar manner.</p>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles which haue not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law: they hauing not the Law are a law vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, which ≈øhew the effect of it written in their hearts, their Con≈øcience al≈øo bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and their thoughts accu≈øing one another, or excu≈øing.</hi> Let <hi>Pilate</hi> heare of a God and he will feare, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Felix.</hi> of judgement, and hee will tremble, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.26. So powerfull is con≈øcience, to put backe the ≈øwellings of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3808:20"/>proude≈øt <hi>Iorden. Io≈øh.</hi> 3.19. And dare boldly tell euery man, as that ≈øtout and re≈øolute <hi>Tragedian</hi> told proud <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey;</hi> the time ≈øhall come wherein thou ≈øhalt fetch many a deepe and deadly ≈øigh, and ≈øorrow de≈øperately, becau≈øe thou ≈øorrowed≈øt no ≈øooner. It is the demand of Nature it ≈øelfe, What ≈øhall we doe to haue eternall life? and becau≈øe Natures meanes are not able to re≈øi≈øt the force and feare of death; no people ≈øo ≈øauage, which hath not thought vpon ≈øome ≈øupernaturall helpe, though ignorance haue ca≈øt them vpon ≈øuper≈øtition, &amp;c. Oh, that the mi≈øerable e≈øtate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which wander in darkene≈ø≈øe, and wote not whither they goe, could giue vs vnder≈øtanding hearts, worthily to e≈øteeme the riches of the mercy of God toward vs, before who≈øe eyes the doores of the kingdome of heauen are ≈øet wide open. Should we offer violence vnto it? it offereth violence vnto vs, and we gather ≈øtrength to with≈øtand it. It is the fault of corrupt nature, and not the lea≈øt, that as ≈øhe hath dimme eyes, ≈øo they are for the mo≈øt part, euen in the be≈øt things, exceedingly mi≈øplaced. She lookes ≈øtill, either forward to the obiect ≈øhe de≈øireth, or downeward to the meanes ≈øhe v≈øeth; neuer turning her eyes either backward, to ≈øee what ≈øhe is, or hath beene; or vpward, to view the true cau≈øe of her good. Alas! What a little ≈øparke, and poore peece of <hi>Adams</hi> old ingenuitie is left aliue in vs, like one of <hi>Iobs</hi> me≈ø≈øengers, to beare witnes of our great lo≈ø≈øe, and what diuine light is extingui≈øhed in vs? It can bring vs to the obiect of our confu≈øion, vnable to ≈øhew vs the lea≈øt glimp≈øe of the obiect of our con≈øolation. O fooli≈øh rea≈øon, how ≈øharpe art thou to ≈øee thy mi≈øchiefe? and yet how blunt, how blind art thou to fore≈øee it? O poore rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of pictie, onely ≈øo much goodne≈ø≈øe left, as to make vs langui≈øh in our owne euill. How are we weakened, how are we weakened by the≈øe relicks of right rea≈øon? not to ≈øee our mi≈øery, that wee may implore Gods mercy, but de≈øpairing in both, as if wee were bani≈øhed from our right wits, ca≈øt our ≈øelues more violently into the iawes of the Prince of hell. O cur≈øt &amp; accur≈øed wits, that for ea≈øe, teach
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3808:20"/>the poore ≈øinner, either to drinke downe his damnation with a greedie ≈øwallow, or el≈øe through horror to chocke him≈øelfe with his owne mor≈øels. Con≈øcience is not alwaies lowd and clamorous, neither are the deadlie≈øt enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp in armes again≈øt vs: yet with ≈øtill murmurings and ≈øecret twitches it bewryes his mi≈ø-likes, and for want of true peace euermore workes priuie and hidden vnquietnes in the heart. There is a lamentable and odious di≈øea≈øe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ileos,</hi> or <hi>mi≈øercre mei Deus.</hi> Nature in expelling ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, contracts and gathers it ≈øelfe from aboue downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but being often and againe hindred by <hi>inflamation, opilation,</hi> and <hi>exulceration,</hi> the <hi>fibres</hi> doe from below gather them≈øelues vpwardes again≈øt nature, and by a <hi>peri≈øtaltick</hi> motion ≈øends backe with violence the excrements by the mouth. So diligent and circum≈øpect is nature to vnburden it ≈øelfe: ≈øo con≈øcience that from aboue would worke vpon the will &amp; affections, being hindred; gathers it ≈øelfe from below, euen from hell it ≈øelfe, and finding the ≈øinner ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, makes him mi≈øerable, and leaues him de≈øperate. Goe too yee Mi≈øcreants of matchle≈ø≈øe mi≈øchiefe, mon≈øters of men, and all ye brethren of the ≈øword, earue to your ≈øelues the large≈øt mor≈øels of ≈øinnefull plea≈øures, and with your mo≈øt able gorges of <hi>Chiucrell con≈øciences</hi> ≈øwallow and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt them; yea, with the ≈øame hands, embrued in blood, receiue the body of your Sauiour, and make him bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with your ≈øinnes: yet I beleeue <hi>all will be bitterne≈ø≈øe in the end,</hi> and how≈øoeuer you cheere vp your ≈øelues, and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate your mindes with the≈øe <hi>huskes of plea≈øure,</hi> yea, cry out, we haue liued the onely royall and ioviall life in the world; yet you ≈øhall neuer per≈øwade me that your hearts do laugh with your faces. Such vanities may ≈øhake the <hi>≈øplene,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience they cannot comfort, be a≈ø≈øured, the kinde≈øt curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies of ≈øinne, like a bemired dogge, doe but defile you with fawning, and leaue you wor≈øe for intermedling. You ≈øay you are merry &amp; ≈øecure, I heare you well. But euery fowle that hath a ≈øeemely feather, hath not the ≈øweete≈øt fle≈øh; nor euery tree that beareth a goodly leafe, bringeth forth good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3808:21"/>fruit: gla≈ø≈øe giueth a cleerer ≈øound then ≈øiluer; many things gli≈øter be≈øides gold: a gorgeous che≈øt is not alwayes the ≈øigne of a rich trea≈øure; nor a faire die, of a fine threed; nor a co≈øtly ≈øeabbard, of a ≈øure blade: nor a merry countenance of a minde, either plea≈øantly di≈øpo≈øed, or ≈øet at quiet. Wee may be a≈ø≈øured many a mans heart bleedeth when his face counterfeits a ≈ømile. Wee ≈øee how ≈øome will laugh at the beating of their heads again≈øt ≈øtone-walles. Yea, but then they are mad, you will ≈øay; true, but not ≈øo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly mad, as they who will ≈ømoothly ≈ømile at the ≈øatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ≈øinnefull de≈øires. <hi>Glow-wormes</hi> in the night may make a fiery and light≈øome ≈øhew, and yet pre≈ø≈øed are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a lumpe of crude &amp; cold moy ≈øture; ≈øo the lampe of the wicked in the night of his ignorance may gli≈øter, but it is ≈øoone put out by the pre≈ø≈øing convul≈øions of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempered con≈øcience. Doe your wor≈øt (you de≈øperate ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) peck out your eyes, or ≈øuffer the Deuill to ≈øeize on them and you, as Rauens doe on ≈øicke ≈øheepe, that hauing plucked out their eyes, deuoure their fle≈øh: yet your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences ≈øhall not be ≈øhifted off. You may runne from your ≈øelues, and the ≈øoule may flie from your bodies: but your con≈øciences will not part from your ≈øoule, not ≈øinne from your con≈øciences. The mute, dumbe, and deafe Deuill charged by Chri≈øt, found a tongue, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 26. ≈øo ≈øhalt thou before thou be di≈øcharged of thy ≈øinne. Quench, and quell the heart of thy heart, roule vpon it the irremouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øtone of hardne≈ø≈øe of heart, ≈øeale it vp in the graue of obliuion, till with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> (<hi>Iob.</hi> 11.39.) it be growne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauory, and would ≈øtink with ≈øtirring: Yet ≈øhalt thou not want a witne≈ø≈øe from the dead, to tell thee of a iu≈øt God, a holy Religion, and a fear efull damnation, euen in that thou knowe≈øt not wherefore thou wert borne, 2. <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 1.8. Oh then that it would plea≈øe God, to giue vs that true wi≈øedome that hath both cleere eyes, and right ≈øet, that wee might ≈øee further then the dimme eyes of nature are able to reach, that we might vnder≈øtand wherefore we are borne, and know that inui≈øible hand, that by mo≈øt happle rules
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3808:21"/>directs all things to their ends. Iu≈øt is it with thee (O Lord) to with hold what thou woulde≈øt giue, and cur≈øe that which thou be≈øtowe≈øt, becau≈øe we abu≈øe the very light of nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24. yea, trample vpon it with daily ≈øins, as men doe the engrauings of Monuments with durtie ≈øhoes, till nothing be left legible. We mu≈øt not therefore pre≈øume much vpon an appeale to a blinded con≈øcience, onely it may force and fa≈øten this vpon vs, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion: fir≈øt, that man is made, ≈øecondly, made for an end, thirdly, an end better then him≈øelfe, fourthly, which end in God, fiftly, which God he is to ≈øerue, ≈øixtly, ≈øerue by a rule: la≈øtly, which rule is Religion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But doth God require it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Mal. 1.6. <hi>A ≈øome honoureth his father, and a ≈øeruant his ma≈øter, if I therefore be a father, where is my honour, and if I be a ma≈øter, where is my feare?</hi> Mic. 6.8. <hi>Hee hath ≈øhewed thee (O man) what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee, &amp;c.</hi> What≈øoeuer then may be our leuell, God mu≈øt be our ≈øcope, at whom in all our affaires we mu≈øt chiefely ayme. O then let not the thought of this la≈øt end, bee the lea≈øt end of our thoughts: we mu≈øt neuer thinke our ≈øelues in good ca≈øe, ≈øo long as we are vnwilling to thinke of our God, who is infinitely good, not onely comprehending, but exceeding the perfections of all things, and therewith al≈øo the la≈øt end of humane de≈øires, and perfect re≈øt of the rea≈øonable ≈øoule. All the ≈øprings and brookes of our be≈øt affections mu≈øt runne into this maine, neither mu≈øt we ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the lea≈øt riveret to be drayned another way, onely this mu≈øt be our care; that neglecting the coun≈øels of fle≈øh &amp; bloud, we learne to depend vpon the commi≈ø≈øion of our Maker, not daring to attempt any action before we haue his warrant, lea≈øt it be ≈øaid vnto vs, <hi>who required the≈øe things at your hands?</hi> I≈øa. 1.12. No action is good without Faith, and no faith is good without a word. The <hi>Centurion,</hi> when he would de≈øcribe his good ≈øeruant in the Go≈øpel, ≈øayes no more of him but this, <hi>I bid him doe this and he doth it.</hi> And the cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell giues an euerla≈øting rule: <hi>His ≈øeruants we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3808:22"/>are to whom wee obey.</hi> Rom. 6.16. So that our ≈øeruice wee owe to our end, is briefely nothing el≈øe, but a readine≈ø≈øe to doe as we are bidden. All arts ≈øerue but two ends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> and from them both, take their denominations of <hi>Diuinitie</hi> and <hi>humanitie.</hi> Say now to thy ≈øelfe, how haue I liued, or rather not liued, con≈øuming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dayes in time eating vanities? Thou art an exqui≈øite humani≈øt; but ≈øuch wi≈øe dome and knowledge will <hi>increa≈øe ≈øorrow and griefe.</hi> Eccl. 1.18. till thou come to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.13. And if grace ≈øcorne not to learne of nature, as <hi>Mo≈øer</hi> refu≈øed not the good coun≈øell of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianite,</hi> then as humane knowledg brings all things to thee; ≈øo let diuine, bring thee vnto God. If God pre≈øerue all for thee, for whom then doe≈øt thou re≈øerue thy ≈øelfe? What for gold, or ≈øome <hi>Herodias?</hi> Can≈øt thou offer God or thy ≈øelfe a greater indignitie? Are all Arts (Philo≈øophy bearing witne≈ø≈øe) <hi>diuine</hi> or <hi>humane,</hi> and the one ≈øub≈øervient to the other? How then can we make the creature our ≈øtanding marke, and not ≈øo much as roue at the Creator? Shall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie teach thee what is good for thy ≈øelfe, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie how thou art good for God, or el≈øe for nothing? For ≈øhame reckon that the greate≈øt part of thy life, is the lea≈øt part wherein thou ha≈øt liued; for all is ≈øpent in vaine, that helpes not to obtaine thy la≈øt end. From hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recouer, and recollect thy ≈øelfe, before thou goe hence, and be no more. And if the excellencie of humane Arts exclude all meane and mediocritie, thinke no exta≈øie high enough for the obtaining of Diuinitie. We mu≈øt not like ≈øullen lades lie vnder our burdens, but reviue our ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and with a maine and manly courage encounter all doubts and difficulties.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how ≈øhall we know it?</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> P≈øal. 34.11. <hi>Come children hearken vntome, and I will teach you the feare of the Lord.</hi> Knowledge is ea≈øie to him that hath a de≈øire to vnder≈øtand, plaine and right, if wee ≈øeeke after it as worldlings doe gold, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.6. and 8.9. and 2.4.5. The Mine and Mint of true happine≈ø≈øe is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3808:22"/>plainely and plentifully chalked out vnto vs in the holy Scriptures. Nothing remaineth but that I call vpon you, as <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> did of old, <hi>Heare O ye worldlings, get you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Hom.</hi> 9. <hi>in Epi≈øt. ad Colof:</hi> Here lie tho≈øe glorious heapes, which may eternally enrich vs: ≈øo that if wee goe away with our hands and skirts emptie, how worthy ≈øhall we be of a mi≈øerable want? And who ≈øhall pitty them, that will not pitty them≈øelues? Gods whip is the be≈øt alones for ≈øo lazie and wilfull a need. Oh that in the≈øe our dayes, wee might ≈øee tho≈øe times ≈øpoken of in <hi>auncient Story,</hi> wherein the ≈øecrets of the Scriptures were knowne familiarly to Taylors, Smiths, weavers, Seam≈øters, Delvers, Near-heards, &amp;c. <hi>Theod. de corrig: Gracorum affect. lib.</hi> 5. What a ≈øhame is it for vs in <hi>England,</hi> to ≈øee daily ≈øo many heauenly ≈øhowers fall be≈øide vs, whiles we ≈øtill like a <hi>Gedeons</hi> fleece want moy≈øture? Where are our worthy Matrones, that may be compared with S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> women,<note place="margin">Hieron. in P≈øal. <hi>133.</hi>
                  </note> who conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in good earne≈øt, who ≈øhould learne mo≈øt Scripture without booke? Alas, alas, mo≈øt of our ≈øchollers, like boyes, ≈ølubber out their Bookes before they learne their le≈ø≈øon. Old <hi>Origen, in num: Hom:</hi> 27. ≈øayd, that of all torments, to read the Scriptures, was the greate≈øt to the damned ≈øpirits, again≈øt that bla≈øphemous Papi≈øt, that ≈øaid it was the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deuill. <hi>Mart. Pare≈ø: de trad. l.</hi> 44. But alas that which they cannot reade without ≈øoruple, we read too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with neglect and contempt. With whom doth the Apo≈øtles exhortation take place, <hi>Colo≈ø≈ø:</hi> 3.16. <hi>Let the word of God dwell plenteou≈øly in you?</hi> Let vs then to auoyd further ≈øhame, like diligent Schollers (which repeat their parts to each other, to be made more perfect) mutually recall ouer the rules of our well-liuing. <hi>Giue me but one</hi> (≈øayth <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine) that loueth, and he ≈øhall feele what I ≈øay, but if I ≈øpeake to a cold Chri≈øtian, he vnder≈øtandeth me not.</hi> O then to prepare you for this art, doe but as you v≈øe to doe in the morning when the Sunne ri≈øeth in his ≈øtrength, open the dores and windowes of your hearts, to partake of this comfortable brightne≈ø≈øe. Let the beames of the glorious truth of Gods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3808:23"/>word ≈øhine cleerely: open your eyes and endeuour to be illu≈øtrated by it. It is not credible, how much good Art and precepts may auaile vs. Wee cannot but ≈øpeed well, if wee begin well, and proceed orderly. A fal≈øe methode is the bane of all hopefull indeuours. We ≈øhall finde it in ≈øpirituall matters, as in our e≈øtates: ≈ømall helpes with good thrift enrich vs, when great patrimonies loo≈øe them≈øelues in the neglect. It is wonderfull to ≈øee what ≈øome can doe with the helpe of a little engine, in lifting vp that weight alone, which many helping hands by their cleare ≈øtrength might endeuour in vaine. I know grace is not tyed either to number or meanes: yet v≈øually worketh by a common cour≈øe of Art and precepts. Onely this mu≈øt be our care, that wee mint not Gods wor≈øhip in our owne deceitfull braines.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Religion is an Art</hi> (or rather a doctrine) <hi>to liue well.</hi> Art is in the frame of the creature, and may be learned by ob≈øervation. And ≈øo was <hi>Diuinitie</hi> by creation the very <hi>impre≈øe</hi> of God; but now by corruption both the Art and the frame are ≈øpoyled, and as he that comes from a bright candle into a darke roome, is ≈øo much more blinded, as his light was greater; and as the pure≈øt yvory turneth with the fire into the deepe≈øt black: ≈øo, man being fallen from God is ≈øo much the wor≈øe, by how much hee was made more worthy in him≈øelfe. <hi>Teknee</hi> from <hi>Teknaomai,</hi> becau≈øe Art is euer to be ≈øeene in his owne fabricke, facture, or fa≈øhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Man therefore hauing blurred, blemi≈øhed, and blotted out his Art and excellencie, is left to the teaching of Gods ≈øpirit, to learne that by diuine in≈øtruction, which he cannot by humane ob≈øervation.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> calls the le≈ø≈øon a doctrine; and <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes often in his P≈øalmes, that the Lord would open his eyes, teach him his ≈øtatutes, and bring him into the way he knowes not by nature. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.18.33. The manifolde wi≈øedome of God di≈øtingui≈øhed by proper ≈øubiects, and broken (as it were) vpon them, by creation, gouernment, and obedience, from hence by irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3808:23"/>or ≈øhining, is acted and di≈øper≈øed vpon the gla≈ø≈øe of the vnder≈øtanding, as light vpon the eye, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and vnder≈øtood, is againe from the mind reflected vpon others by word, and then it is <hi>doctrine</hi> or <hi>di≈øcipline,</hi> or <hi>writing,</hi> and then we call it a <hi>booke</hi> or <hi>Bible,</hi> and from hence may be ob≈øerued our teaching by Scripture, doctrine, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Art, ≈øcience, and in≈øpiration, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.10. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. &amp;c. God hath written &amp; ≈øpoken, and in≈øpired men to doe both, and yet in all this a meere ≈øtranger to the iudgements, thoughts, affections, ≈øpeeches, and actions of the mo≈øt. So that be≈øide all this, God mu≈øt inlighten and inliuen our hearts, or el≈øe there will neither be Art, nor heart, nor part to thinke vpon him. It is ≈øafe no where to complaine of nature, but where grace is, and where that is once had and affected, It will readily a≈øcribe both inward and outward teaching to God. Our rule may be called <hi>Scripture</hi> as it is written, <hi>doctrine</hi> as it is taught, <hi>di≈øcipline</hi> as it is learned, <hi>Art,</hi> as it is framed in vs againe, <hi>≈øcience</hi> as it is knowne of vs; and becau≈øe none of the≈øe are now to be had by the irradiation of nature, it plea≈øeth God of his infinite loue, that wee ≈øhould haue them by the in≈øpiration of grace. There are three things (≈øaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) which God properly challengeth vnto him≈øelfe, from all co-workers, men and Angels: <hi>viz. prade≈øtination, creation,</hi> and <hi>in≈øpiration.</hi> The husbandman may plant, prune, digge and dre≈ø≈øe his Vine, but raine vpon it he cannot: if hee would water it, yet mu≈øt it be with Gods water. Hee may draw from the fountaine, but God mu≈øt drowne it; he may <hi>ducere rivum,</hi> but it is God that mu≈øt <hi>implore fontem.</hi> Yea, when he hath planted and watered, he cannot giue clu≈øters to the branches, forme to the fruits, qualitie to the ≈øeeds, temper to the ≈øea≈øons: God therefore that can doe all is the be≈øt husbandman. Man therefore that hath expired his fir≈øt life, mu≈øt haue God to in≈øpire him againe, or el≈øe hee cannot liue. And this will appeare in the very name wee giue our rule. <hi>Religion</hi> is to tie againe. Our loue to God, like the new cords of <hi>Samp≈øon,</hi> was quickly ≈ønapt a≈øunder,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3808:24"/>God, therfore, that he might bind vs to him≈øelfe by a ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cord, hath cho≈øen the grace of faith to revnite vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to him≈øelfe. And ≈øo Religion hath his notation from the fir≈øt part of our rule, which is <hi>faith</hi> in God. Or el≈øe may it take his denomination from the ≈øecond part, which is <hi>obedience</hi> towards God. The law that was to be read by creation, was obliterated, and in a manner ≈øcraped our by corruption, but now againe by religion is written in our hearts. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. and ≈øo is to be read againe. Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in vnion and action, now by faith wee haue the one, and by the law we performe the other. The rule of life is called Diuinitie, in regard of God the end of it, Theologie in regard of the ≈øubiect matter, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. <hi>logia Theou,</hi> words of God: but of all names this comes neere≈øt the forme of our Art, which ≈øignifies either our tying againe to God, or reading againe the things of God. This bond is the ≈øure≈øt, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. And this booke is the plaine≈øt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. For as faith binds vs to God, ≈øo it giues and gaines ≈øuch power from him, as wee may walke acceptably before him. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. And here we ≈øee how pittifull and plentiful a God we haue, in rai≈øing of vs from corruption to greater perfection, then ever we enioyed by creation. This ≈øecond bond is invincible, for ≈øo it becomes the Almightie to proceed in his workes. He that hath ≈øhewed man what he can doe for him≈øelfe, ≈øhall now ≈øee what God can doe for him. And God were not faithfull, if there were either finall or fatall Apo≈øta≈øie from a iu≈øtifying faith. It is folly to imagine, that God ≈øhould goe from one imperfection to another. Loue was for try-all, faith is for tru≈øt. God hath tried the weakne≈ø≈øe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedne≈ø≈øe of our loue; It is now for vs to tru≈øt him vpon the faith of our ≈øaluation. Water cannot ≈øuddenly be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but with lei≈øure, and by degrees, and ≈øome time mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be required to beare and beate backe tho≈øe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes wherunto we haue a long time beene envred.

We liue groaping, as the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> after lifes doore, and hauing wearied our ≈øelues, goe away wanting the thing, we both wi≈øhed and waited for.

So ≈øever God from the ≈øoule, and what is man but a dead carrion? All the elements and elementaries lighten and darken, coole and warme, die and reviue, as the Sunne pre≈øents or ab≈øents it ≈øelfe from them; ≈øo wee liue or die, feele or faint, as the Sunne of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, parts or revnites him≈øelfe vnto vs. Whereby we are taught, that primarily and principally we liue by God, as the ≈øoule of our ≈øoules; and ≈øecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by faith, as the Spirits. The bond of ≈øoule and body here is that heat, or heauenly breath, that knitts God and man together in an indivi≈øible and in≈øoluble knott. If the Lyons, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.16. ravenous bea≈øts by nature, and made keene with hunger, adore the fle≈øh of a faithfull man, ≈øhall any worldly thing change his heart, alter his affection, or Gods to him? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the earth ≈øhall ≈øooner ≈øhake, the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the world tremble, the countenance of heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale, the Sunne loo≈øe his light, the Moone her beautie, the Starres their glory, &amp;c. then a man knit to God by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be once ≈øeperated from him againe.

This taske of faving ≈øoules is left whole for grace to bu≈øie her ≈øelfe about it. Alas, nothing is left in vs but the ruines and relicks of our ≈øinnes, and the iudgements of our God.

And as hunger maketh riffe raffe &amp; odious viands tooth≈øome; or as the vicious ≈øtomacke can feed hungerly on coales and a≈øhes: ≈øo the greedie ≈øinner can with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light devour the murthering mor≈øels of his owne mi≈øery. In darkne≈ø≈øe, Starres of the greate≈øt magnitude are not to be ≈øeene, nor the millions of moats that lie in blindnes: ≈øo, who knowes the magnitude or multitude of his ≈øins. O Lord if thou ≈øhine not vpon vs, wee ≈øleepe in darknes. If thou ≈øaue vs not in thy ≈øonne, we peri≈øh in our ≈øelues. O that we could be netled with the newes of our mi≈øerie. Can we ≈øee our Sauiour mourne for it; whiles we haue no grace to mourne for it our ≈øelues? Should not this ≈øtrike vs in the very ≈øtriking, and fetch teares from our eyes? If he that was without ≈øinne would not be without ≈øtripes for vs, ≈øhall we thinke to be cockered, like <hi>Adoniah,</hi> of our heauenly Father? Lord ≈øtrike our hearts with the rod of thy word, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈ømote the hard rocke, that our ≈øtonie hearts may gu≈øh forth plentifull rivers of teares, becau≈øe we haue not kept thy Law. Let vs no longer like fooles laugh when we are la≈øhed of our ≈øinnes. Tran≈øplant vs into thy Sonne, for as we are, both the ≈øtocke and the griffe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; It was onely for our Sauiour as a ≈øweet Impe to grow out of a Crab≈øtocke. But if thy mercy feoffe vs not in the ble≈ø≈øings and vertues of thy Sonne, as our ≈øinnes doe feoffe vs in the cur≈øes of our parents, we peri≈øh. They are gro≈ø≈øe faltterers of nature, that tell her ≈øhee is cleane, yea, aliue. O the vn≈øpeakeable mercy of our God, that whiles wee provided him the ≈øinne, he provides vs the remedie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an expiation as early as our ≈øinnes; the pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Lambe of God ≈ølaine from the beginning of the world. Thus, thus, whiles the clamour and feare of our fall, to our affrighted con≈øciences runnes on like fire in a traine, to the very vtmo≈øt rankes of our bodies and ≈øoules, euery part and power fearing their fellowes, no le≈ø≈øe, then them≈øelues are affraid: even then to the true beleeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the bloud of him, who <hi>purgeth our con≈øciences from dead workes,</hi> Heb. 9.14. Nay, ≈øo admirable a lenatiue, that it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3808:26"/>leaues <hi>no more con≈øcience of ≈øinne.</hi> Heb. 10.12. But from the name and notation, let vs come to the definition; and fi≈øt, that which is generall, a <hi>doctrine.</hi> Our once lo≈øt law of life is left to the teaching of the word, and Spirit. Sinfull man being dull and deafe of hearing, had need to haue his heart prepared &amp; made ready by all meanes to receiue the truth. The Scriptures are not penned like an Art in order and methode; and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the truth could not be offered to man directly, who lookes a≈øquint, but on all ≈øides, that he may be hit with them on ≈øome ≈øide. The fir≈øt thunder-bolt that did ≈øtrike through the ≈øoule of man, was <hi>Adam,</hi> thou ha≈øt ≈øinned, and art the childe of death. By creation in wonderfull ≈øilence was the law written in the fle≈øhy Tables of our hearts, and as things, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in barkes of trees, did daily grow out by corruption; therefore he thought it high time to write in in tables of ≈øtone, as more faithfull monuments then our hearts. And when he comes to driue it into the iron hearts of men, hee takes ≈øtate vpon him, as one that will be trembled at, in his word and judgements. There was nothing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of the Law that might not worke a≈øtoni≈øhment. The eyes dazled and dimmed with lightnings, the eares torne with thunders roaring in them. The voyce of the Almightie wrapped in ≈ømoake and fire, and out-≈øpeaking both, the clamor of the trumpet, and clappes of thunder, and that in ≈øuch a manner, as he did rather ≈øeeme to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten then teach, forbid then command, deterre then define what he would haue done. More negatiues in oppo≈øition to what men would doe, then affirmatiues in direction to what men ≈øhould doe. By which wee are to vnder≈øtand that he that was ≈øo terrible a Law-giuer, would one day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as ≈øevere a judge. If he were ≈øo dreadfull in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, he would be as fearefull in the execution. Oh! how will this fiery Law fla≈øh terrour in the face of euery hard and impenitent ≈øinner, when at the day of iudgment his con≈øcience like another <hi>Sinai,</hi> ≈øhall tremble and quake before the Iudge? then ≈øhall he ≈øee the Law that was giuen
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3808:27"/>in fire, in fire to bee required. By this promulgation I plainely ≈øee how difficult a thing it is to teach a ≈øinner. If God ≈øhould not change our hearts. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11.19.20. his Me≈ø≈øengers might as well (with our venerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Beda</hi>) preach to heapes of ≈øtones, as to the ≈øtony hearts of carnall men. There is none but God, that is able to giue the fir≈øt charge, neither any to heare it but ≈øuch as are taught of him. There mu≈øt be a putting in of the rule, before there will be any putting forth of man to obey it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. and 32.40. the noy≈øe of the word. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈ø.</hi> 5.4. ≈øhaking of afflictions. <hi>Ob</hi> 33.16. or day light of the Go≈øpell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11.12. are but ≈øecundary helping cau≈øes, and doe nothing without the principall. He that is a≈øleepe awakes not till his naturall heat returne, hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted all tho≈øe foggie mi≈øts and vapours that did bind vp the ≈øen≈øes: no more is there any awaking of the ≈øinner, till there be a returne of that ≈øupernaturall heat of grace, whereby the vapours of fle≈øhly lu≈øtes may bee di≈ø≈øolved within vs, which darken the cogitation, and oppre≈ø≈øe the heart. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.24. onely here is the difference, that this is a dead ≈øleepe, whereby the hear of creation is vtterly extingui≈øhed; ≈øo that a new ≈øpirit mu≈øt be put within vs, or el≈øe wee never <hi>crucifie the fle≈øh with the lu≈øts and affections thereof,</hi> which would keepe vs in a perpetuall ≈øleepe, far ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing the ≈øeuen ≈øleepers in the time of <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour, or <hi>Epimenides</hi> the <hi>Cretian,</hi> which ≈ølept foure≈øcore yeeres in a Caue: ≈øo ≈øayes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of fables, and take his word alone, I am not his ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but this is no forgery that many a man out-≈øleepes his naturall life. It is reported of <hi>Diony≈øius</hi> the <hi>Herocleote,</hi> that he felt not when men thru≈øt needles into his fat belly: ≈øo ≈øinners, who≈øe hearts are as fat as grea≈øe. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.70 feele not their mi≈øery. Nay, like the <hi>Fencer</hi> that laughed to ≈øee his wounds lanched by the Surgeon. The beares ≈øpoken of in <hi>Plinie,</hi> that could not be ≈øtirred with the ≈øharpe≈øt prickles, come ≈øhort of a thicke skinned ≈øinner. Alas, how many ≈øhutt all their ≈øen≈øes, that they may not be troubled
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3808:27"/>with the terrible threats of the Almightie. Euen as the old <hi>Italians,</hi> in the time of thunder, ≈øhot off their greate≈øt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and did ring their deepe≈øt bells, to drowne the noy≈øe of the heauens: ≈øo wretched offenders know how to out-cry and out-roare the highe≈øt. But they that thus har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and hearten them≈øelues again≈øt Gods word, ≈øhall one day be taught to <hi>cry to the hills and mountaines to cover them from the pre≈øence of him</hi> whom ≈øo often they haue de≈øpi≈øed. The Lord teach vs to li≈øten to him here, lea≈øt neglecting the light of his word, wee feele the heat of his wrath in hell, and be made to finde that to our co≈øt, which neuer had our care, and to ≈øinart with paine, for what we neuer heard with patience. But if I ≈øhould in≈øi≈øt vpon euery head as I might well, and with profit, I ≈øhould write a <hi>Salmeron</hi>-like Commentary vpon <hi>Petrarches</hi> remedies, &amp; yet doubt whether ≈øo this worke would be perfect: ≈øure I am a life would bee too little to write it, and but enough to read it. I will hereafter goe on with the heads as ≈øhortly as I may, and giue as much good coun≈øell in a narrow roome as I ≈øhal be able. Brevitie where it is neither ob≈øcure nor defectiue is very plea≈øing, even to the daintie≈øt iudgements. I will as neere as I may in ≈øo large an Art imitate tho≈øe that draw great per≈øonages in little tablets, and de≈øcribe worlds of Countries in the compa≈ø≈øe of ≈ømall Maps: I hope if wee haue ≈øpeciall care of matter and methode, wee ≈øhall make this Doctrine more portable for memory, and readier for v≈øe. If our precepts as nailes driue out one another, you may iu≈øtly impute it to want of Art. I ≈øhall follow him that is now with God, and which I confe≈ø≈øe hath broken the Ice before me. The forme of the Art is to liue well. There is a naturall life which we liue by the vnion of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ≈øoule; and there is a ≈øpirituall life, which we haue by the knot ≈øpoken of, to wit, our vnion with God by Religion. Now all men, in that they will haue ≈øome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may be ≈øaid to liue ≈øpiritually, but they cannot liue well, becau≈øe they want a true rule of life. The follies of the Heathen are baits for babes, no bookes for Chri≈øtians:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3808:28"/>which onely depend vpon God and his word, to teach them truely how to liue, but let vs cleare our definition by Scripture. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. <hi>A doctrine according to godline≈ø≈øe.</hi> Tit. 1.1. <hi>The acknowledgement of the truth which is after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe.</hi> Fir≈øt, this Art is in God. Secondly, wee receiue it from him as the paterne and patent of his will. Thirdly, our examples are to accord with it. Hence godline≈ø≈øe in the example, mu≈øt an≈øwere godline≈ø≈øe in the rule, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe in the rule mu≈øt bee according to that which is in God. God plots the rule, then he publi≈øheth it, as his will and command; and la≈øtly, lookes for obedience at our hands. A <hi>king</hi> fir≈øt plots his government in him≈øelfe, then by Proclamation makes it knowne vnto his ≈øubiects; and la≈øtly, vnder penaltie enioynes the keeping of it. A <hi>Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> fir≈øt makes letters in his head, then pens them downe with his hand, and guides the Scholler accordingly: So, God is the Author of Religion, then he publi≈øheth it, and wee are to liue after it. To liue well in practi≈øe, is to liue well by precept; and precept that brings vs to the Prince of our happine≈ø≈øe. <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.5. it is called <hi>the feare and knowledge of God.</hi> Iam. 3.15. It is ≈øayd to be <hi>wi≈øedome from aboue.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.3. through this knowledge <hi>wee receiue of God all things that pertaine vnto life and godline≈ø≈øe.</hi> To conclude, giue thy ≈øelfe wholy to learne this Art, and deferre it not to thy la≈øt: wilt thou charge this greate≈øt burden vpon the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke≈øt bea≈øt? If thou can≈øt not pa≈ø≈øe over the foord when the waters are low, how wilt thou doe when they are ri≈øen? Twigges at the fir≈øt will bend to euery hand, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will not be bowed with all thy might. Sparkes are ≈øooner quenched then flames, and greene wounds ≈øooner cured then fe≈øtred ≈øores: he that driueth a naile, fir≈øt ≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ea≈øily, and afterwards redoubleth in ≈øtrength, in ≈øo much as the more blowes he ≈øtriketh, the more it is fa≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the harder it will be to draw it forth againe: ≈øo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breake the bands, ≈øhake off the ≈øhakles of ≈øinnes, and be daily labouring to ≈øaue thy poore ≈øoule.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3808:29"/>Gal. 5.6. and <hi>loue fulfils the law.</hi> Rom. 13.10. not by action, but intention; for <hi>it is the end of the law.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.5. God accepting ≈øincere loue for perfect dutie. By faith wee are ≈øpiritually glued and cimented to God, that we may bee one ≈øpirituall body with him; in which ≈øen≈øe it is ≈øaid, <hi>He that is glued to the Lord is one ≈øpirit.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.17. <hi>Cords</hi> will bind, ≈øo will the <hi>cords of loue.</hi> Ho≈ø. 11.4. Zach. 11.7. But cords may be vnknitt: Nailes will fa≈øten, and <hi>wee haue the words of the wi≈øe as nailes fa≈øtned by the ma≈øters of the a≈ø≈øemblies.</hi> Eccl. 12.11. but yet nailes may ≈ølip, or leaue a chinke: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the glew of faith. ioynes all clo≈øe together, or rather both the≈øe parts <hi>will cau≈øe vs, with full purpo≈øe of heart to cleaue vnto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.23. The heat of faith and loue will dige≈øt this whole Art, that it may be di≈øtributed into the veines of euery good word and worke. The≈øe two will make vp a perfect paire of compa≈ø≈øes, that can truely take the latitude of this Art. And fir≈øt mu≈øt wee haue faith as the one foote pitcht vpon the Center, which is God, whiles obedience as the other walkes about in a perfect circle of all good duties. The fire of faith, and light of life, will evince again≈øt the gates of hell, the vndoubted truth of Religion. So that by the≈øe ≈øweete and cordiall flames may the ≈øoule of euery Chri≈øtian warme it ≈øelfe, again≈øt all tho≈øe cold de≈øpaires whereunto Satan tempteth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The fir≈øt part of Religion, whereby from knowledge I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God;</hi> the fir≈øt act of faith is pa≈ø≈øiue in receiuing what God giueth. And ≈øo layes hold of happine≈ø≈øe, workes it not: Faith makes iu≈øt, as the hand makes rich, that is filled with the wealth of another; or, as the Iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers boxe, ba≈øe in it ≈øelfe, is made precious for the pearles it containeth: Here may wee iu≈øtly ≈øay, it is a poorer and meaner act to beleeue, then loue; nay, rather pa≈ø≈øion then action; for, we are fir≈øt <hi>apprehended</hi> of God before we <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> him againe <hi>Phil</hi> 3.12. This grace is mo≈øt freely graced, that it might the more frankely reflect all vpon God a gaine. And becau≈øe it is the roote of all the re≈øt will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3808:29"/>teach humilitie, &amp; exclude boa≈øting: like the ful eare of corn that hanges downe the head towards the originall, or if any be ≈øo graciou≈øly exalted, and freely favoured aboue his fellowes, that his ≈øtalke is ≈øo ≈øtiffe, that it beares him vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the re≈øt of his ridge, then faith will make him looke vp to heauen aboue, not in the thoughts of pride, but in the humble vowes of thankefulne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øay with <hi>Mary, the Lord hath regarded the low e≈øtate of his ≈øervant.</hi> Thus will faith (rightly vnder≈øtood) teach vs to knead nature in the durt and du≈øt, and ≈øpoyle our free will of all her proud ragges, loading her with reproches, and giue all glory to him, that ≈øayes he will not giue it vnto another. Papi≈øts being of late more a≈øhamed then before, doe confe≈ø≈øe all is giuen: but (≈øay they) is it not all one to pay a ≈øumme, and haue ≈øo much giuen mee as may pay it? No doubt, Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues a full di≈øcharge, makes it not. We rather by Faith receiue an acquitance ≈øealed in the blood of Chri≈øt, then the blood of Chri≈øt to make our owne workes meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which we may offer to God in payment for our ≈øelues. Eternall life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. is both merit and mercie, we take it as a gift, Chri≈øt earnes it as wages, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Saluation through faith, yet not of our ≈øelues.</hi> Here lies the errour of the Papi≈øts, euen in faith it ≈øelfe, and euery other good grace of the ≈øpirit, that our free will hath his intervention and operation, betwixt Gods giuing and our taking: ≈øo that if God will but beare halfe the charges by his co-operation, man ≈øhall vnder-take to merit his owne glory, and fulfill the royall law ≈øo abundantly, that he ≈øhall haue ≈øomething over and aboue, to be very beneficiall and helpefull to his needie neighbours. But the way of the law is longer then our pur≈øey hearts, and ≈øhort legges can reach to the end and perfection of it. As <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> ≈øayd to <hi>Ace≈øius</hi> the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Set vp ladders and climbe to heauen:</hi> ≈øo I to Papi≈øts, ≈øcale heauen by your workes; as for vs we haue found another way, and that is to a≈øcend vpon <hi>Iacobs ladder.</hi> Wee leaue tuggling and ≈øtrugling that way to preuaile, and fall with <hi>Iacob</hi> to wre≈øtle with Chri≈øt for a ble≈ø≈øing. And though we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3808:30"/>goe lymping by our ≈øinnes, yet by our conquering Faith wee ≈øhall be Princes with God. By this therefore the vaunt of Papi≈øts, mu≈øt needs avaunt: yet further, faith in another act will cut the very winde-pipe of our free-will, and merit. It is wittily ≈øayd of one, that faith in regard of his pa≈ø≈øiue act is rather a beggarly receiver, then a de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving worker: all our conver≈øion is pa≈ø≈øiue; but ≈øee faith in our actiue conver≈øion, and you ≈øhall ≈øee workes a forme too low to come in any ≈øuch reque≈øt, as to iu≈øtifie. For what is faith, but as the hand of the ≈øoule? and what is the dutie of the hand, but eyther to hold or to worke? This hand then holds in the fir≈øt part of Divinitie, and workes in the ≈øecond. Now without all que≈øtion, Iu≈øtification is to be taught in our fir≈øt part, and therefore goes before obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and faith, which is as an in≈øtrument or hand, for to hold Chri≈øt to iu≈øtification, is mightie and operatiue both for ≈øanctification and new obedience. Workes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the effects of ≈øanctification, and ≈øanctification is the effect of iu≈øtification; hence is it impo≈ø≈øible to be iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by workes as cau≈øes, as effects and fruits they may ≈øhew it. If then the ≈øecret apprehen≈øion of the clo≈øed hand of faith hide what it holdeth; ≈øee the hand of faith open to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie the cau≈øe by the evidence of the effects, &amp; in this ≈øen≈øe workes may iu≈øtifie and perfect faith, as the ≈øecond part of any Art doth the fir≈øt. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.22.24. Papi≈øts again≈øt the whole order of Diuinitie would haue our workes to v≈øher in our Iu≈øtification, nay, as parents to beget it. Whereas they are in very deed the companions and pages, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable attendants of faith, and the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Faith is both the mindes te≈øtimony in regard of the word, and the wills Amen, in regard of the ≈øpirit. <hi>Creed</hi> comes of <hi>credo,</hi> which ≈øignifies to ≈øee a thing certainely, and yeeld to it affiance. It is compounded of <hi>cernere,</hi> and <hi>dare. Pro certo videre, &amp; pro certo dare.</hi> Hence <hi>Faiths</hi> motto, <hi>Caco nulli.</hi> By faith wee know whom wee haue beleeued. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And our Creed puts vs in mind of knowledge and affiance in faith: ≈øo the word it ≈øelfe teacheth no le≈ø≈øe;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3808:30"/>for <hi>Faith</hi> comes of <hi>Fides,</hi> and <hi>fides</hi> of <hi>fiat dictum,</hi> where we haue God to ≈øay the word, and we ≈øay Amen vnto it. The <hi>auncient Romanes</hi> at the very gate of their <hi>Pantheon,</hi> pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faith with two hands clo≈øed together, intimating, that there was no comming to God but by the hand of faith. And Grace, which ≈øcorneth not to learne of Nature any good (though not <hi>Athens</hi> but <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> mu≈øt teach this le≈ø≈øon) can take this advice, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> heard the good coun≈øell of a <hi>Midianite,</hi> that <hi>he that commeth to God mu≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God, is, and that hee is a rewarder of all them that ≈øeeke him diligently.</hi> Heb. 11.6. That faith is the fir≈øt part is cleare. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33.34. and 32.40. Fir≈øt, God writes in vs this principle of life, and then we obey him. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19.20. and 36.26. Fir≈øt, he puts in his ≈øpirit, and then cau≈øeth vs to walke in his ≈øtatutes. Such is the ≈øervile, or rather bruiti≈øh nature of man, that he can neither be ≈øtirred, or ≈øtayed in any good cour≈øe, except there go a new forming of his heart, before there be any reforming of his life. As dead bodies are rubbed without heat: ≈øo doe wee in vaine force vpon our ≈øelues, an heartle≈ø≈øe Religion without faith; all our life here is but a vitall death without it; till wee liue that life wee doe but carry our carca≈ø≈øes vp and downe carele≈øly, and doe nothing plea≈øing vnto God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. secondly, that faith is from knowledge, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.69. and 16.30. and 17.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. and that with affiance in God. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 40.4. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.22. hence <hi>faith is a confidence in God, vpon a particular a≈ø≈øurance from God, that he is my God.</hi> Mark. 9.24. Rom. 4.20.21.2. Tim. 1.12. Faith layes not hold of God, as we take hold of a tree, or ≈øome ≈øuch like ≈øencele≈ø≈øe thing, but as we v≈øe to doe in our ≈øalutations, when there is a mutuall imbracing and ki≈ø≈øing of each other. <hi>[a≈øpa≈øamenoi]</hi> Heb. 12.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Seeing faith ≈øolely re≈øts vpon God, what is God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>God in regard of him≈øelfe onely knows him≈ølefe, as dwelling in the light vnaprochable, whom neuer man ≈øaw, neither can ≈øee.</hi> 1. Tim. 6.16. Ioh. 1.18. 1. Ioh. 4.12. The Sunne and the fire ≈øay of them≈øelues, come not too neere, how much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3808:31"/>more the light which none can atraine vnto. Here the well is not onely deepe, but wee want a bucket to draw withall. God to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> Exod. 33.20. giues both the rule and the rea≈øon; <hi>thou can≈øt not ≈øee my face and liue: for, there ≈øhall none ≈øee me and liue.</hi> I mu≈øt contract my meditations, lea≈øt the Art grow too big with amplifications. It would be an excellent worke, to write a booke by it ≈øelfe of the knowledge of <hi>Iehovah Elohim:</hi> It ≈øhall now be ≈øufficient to lay downe the precepts, with ≈øhort expo≈øitions, and as pregnant proofes as we can.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God is both incomprehen≈øible by rea≈øon, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nameable by words,</hi> and con≈øequently aboue all Arts; for <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logicke</hi> are the mo≈øt generall, and goe before all other ≈øciences, nothing being to be conceiued without them. <hi>Iob</hi> 11.7.8.9. God is not to be found out by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, therefore he cannot be mea≈øured by quantitie. <hi>Iob</hi> 36.26. too great for the finite vnder≈øtanding. God being the fir≈øt is mo≈øt intelligible, for prioritie of nature, ever goes with per≈øpicuitie of apprehen≈øion: But this is in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, who be≈øt knowes his owne being, yea, better then any thing be≈øide it: although man better knowes other things then him≈øelfe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.29. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Gods name,</hi> as his nature, <hi>is ≈øecret,</hi> and not be ≈øought; and this doth wonderfully ≈øtrengthen faith; for, if God were not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our apprehen≈øion, he could not helpe vs infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The holding of God by faith, is better then our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him by rea≈øon. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.20. <hi>God is able to doe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundantly, aboue all we can aske by words, or thinke by rea≈øon.</hi>

God names him≈øelfe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. He appeares by one name and not by another: that is, by his ≈øufficiencie to giue <hi>Canaan,</hi> not by his effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in doing it as yet. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19.20. God will not ≈øhew <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> his glory, but he will ≈øit his goodne≈ø≈øe to pa≈ø≈øe before him: and <hi>ver.</hi> 22.23. hee covers and vncovers, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> might be≈øt ≈øee him. We (like narrow mouth'd ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels) mu≈øt receiue this knowledge by drops, and that with the greater difficultie, becau≈øe wee are full alreadie; for, as in nature there is no vacuitie, but either aire or more ≈øolide ≈øub≈øtance fills all: ≈øo in the minde, as it is emptie of grace and goodne≈ø≈øe, ≈øo is it filled with vaine conceitedne≈ø≈øe, which is an exceeding hinderance to better knowledge; and therefore, as in a ve≈ø≈øell, ≈øo much liquor as goes in, ≈øo much aire goes out: ≈øo, the vnder≈øtanding, as it is filled with wi≈øedom:, ≈øo is it emptied of folly. Hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that the be≈øt ve≈ø≈øell cannot be quite full in this life, becau≈øe of the remainders of corruption. We mu≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3808:32"/>neither be impatient of Gods delay in revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, nor content with our ≈ømall mea≈øure; but ever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to haue one drop added to another, vntil it ≈øhall plea≈øe God to fill our ve≈ø≈øell to the brim. There is nothing created, what hat his being and perfection together, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing growes from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength, till it come to his compleate ≈øtature. Onely herein grace is contrary to nature, ever ≈øtronge≈øt at la≈øt, and at be≈øt changeth not, like his fountaine, in whom is no ≈øhadow by turning. Surely, he that here maketh profe≈ø≈øion of goodne≈ø≈øe, if he find not him≈øelfe be≈øt at la≈øt, may well feare he was never good.

God in him≈øelfe all-≈øufficient, and for vs are warder. Seeing this is ≈øo, let vs never pre≈øcribe his wi≈øedome, ha≈øten his mercy. His grace for the pre≈øent ≈øhall be enough for vs; his glory will bee more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. With men the rule is good, <hi>fir≈øt try, and then tru≈øt:</hi> but with God we mu≈øt fir≈øt tru≈øt him, as ≈øufficient to helpe vs, and then try him in his workes: and wee may be a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is as po≈ø≈øible for him to deceiue vs, as not to be. Either now di≈øtru≈øt his being, or el≈øe confe≈ø≈øe thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and with patience expect his promi≈øed con≈øolation.

Can wee part with earthly things in pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, for hope of better in future rever≈øion, and giue the all-≈øufficient no time for the reture of his promi≈øes? No age afforded more para≈øites, fewer friends; we flatter with God, when we ≈øay, we loue him, and leaue him for delay. The mo≈øt are friendly in ≈øight, ≈øerviceable in expectation, hollow in loue, tru≈øtle≈ø≈øe in experience; they will giue God a glad welcome whil≈øt he is a doing for them, and as willing afarewell when hee doth de≈øi≈øt, nay, a little withdraw for triall: but hee that truely knowes the ≈øufficiencie of his God, will wait vpon his efficiencie without grudging. Rats and Mice runne to the full Barne, leaue it when it is emptie: So, dung-hill creatures for their bellies ≈øerue God, and flintch from him in their want.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is that whereby be is the fir≈øt and mo≈øt ab≈øolute being.</hi> Being is that whereby a thing is truely and really in e≈ø≈øence, or exi≈øtence. And it is either the <hi>fir≈øt being,</hi> or that which is <hi>from the fir≈øt.</hi> Now God is the fir≈øt. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 41.4. <hi>and</hi> 48.12. and therefore e≈ø≈øentially one. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 46.9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Eth.</hi> 4.6. Furthermore, God is ab≈øolute, as being independent from any other. There was a fir≈øt man, and a fir≈øt in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kinde of creature, but no ab≈øolute fir≈øt, ≈øaue God. <hi>Exed.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.58. If any aske me why wee define the e≈ø≈øence of God, ≈øeeing wee formerly ≈øayd it was not knowne of vs, our an≈øwere is, wee define it relatiuely, not ≈øimply, to wit, as it is a fir≈øt, and that ab≈øolute fir≈øt being is knowne be≈øt in it ≈øelfe, and ≈øo is God; for, there is nothing more intelligible then he; yet of vs nothing is le≈ø≈øe knowne, we come to him by ≈øeconds, and the begins of other things. Which proue nece≈ø≈øarily a fir≈øt, and that ab≈øolutely; for, two will proue one to goe before, and dependent beings will proue an independent. The Sunne beames are more vi≈øible to our eyes, when they are ca≈øt obliquely vpon their obiects, then when they fall directly: ≈øo, wee mu≈øt ≈øhew you God rather in the ble≈ø≈øings we receiue from him, then tho≈øe excellencies which are in him. It is the be≈øt and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3808:36"/>longe≈øt le≈ø≈øon even thus to learne him, and of ≈øure≈øt v≈øe: which alone if wee take not out, it were better not to haue liued. Oh, that we would often exerci≈øe, to acquaint our nature, and draw it into ≈øome familiaricie with God, the very ≈øoule and being of it. And though at fir≈øt wee make but our fire of greene wood, yet not to bee tyred with blowing, vntill our devotions be ≈øet on flame. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, God will helpe, by enlightning our vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, till we be wholly enflamed with a loue of him.

               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ob≈øervation of the e≈ø≈øentiall name of God; as, <hi>Lehovah, Iah, Eheie.</hi> The fir≈øt word delivers vnto vs ≈øuch an e≈ø≈øence as ever was, is, and ≈øhall be. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ie,</hi> is a note of the Future ten≈øe; <hi>Ho,</hi> of the Pre≈øent, and <hi>Vah</hi> of the Preterperfect ten≈øe: and ≈øo is well expounded. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. But ill expounded by tho≈øe, which by them would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> giuing the pre≈øent to the Father, pa≈øt to the ≈øonne, and to come to the Spirit. Yet it is true the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of him≈øelfe, and as the pre≈øent begins time, ≈øo he the action: it is al≈øo true that the Sonne works from him, and therefore pa≈ø≈øeth on the action, as that which is pa≈øt doth time. Neyther can this be denyed but that the Spirit worketh from them both, and ≈øo fini≈øheth te acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the future doth the poynts and periods of time. But this word is e≈ø≈øentiall, and not per≈øonall, and therefore is giuen of God to expre≈ø≈øe the e≈ø≈øence, not the per≈øons. <hi>Iah</hi> is contracted of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> not to ≈øignifie a diminute God, as if it were the diminutiue thereof: but ≈øtill for e≈ø≈øence and pre≈øent being. Neither is it applyed to Chri≈øt, humbled in the fle≈øh, as if that were the diminution of it, but it is the denomination of one and thee ≈øelfe ≈øame glorious e≈ø≈øence in all the per≈øons. <hi>Eheie,</hi> is as much as, I will be, which no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3808:36"/>creature can peremptorily affirme. Time changeth all things, and there is none that hath the command of it, but he alone that gaue it beginning, and continuance, and to whom the account of our very houres are due, and be≈øt knowne. But I mu≈øt not lead you from <hi>Elins</hi> into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈ø≈øe, and leauing the wells of water, trouble you with the barrenne≈ø≈øe of mans braine. Take the≈øe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for confirmation, and further illu≈øtration. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>and</hi> 15.2.3. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 68.4. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 42.8. Happy are we that wee re≈øt vpon ≈øuch a being, and may enioy all things in him, and him in all things, nothing in it ≈øelfe, ≈øo ≈øhall our ioyes neyther change nor peri≈øh: for, how ever the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues may alter and fade, yet he in whom they are ours, is ever like him≈øelfe, con≈øtant, and everla≈øting.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes in the ≈øecond place?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>That God is free and voyd of all power, either to be, or be otherwi≈øe then he is.</hi> And therefore faith re≈øts vpon a mo≈øt ≈øub≈øtantiall and immutable being.

Cau≈øes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile in euery creature, but the Creator is voyde of them. And hereupon God is from him≈øelfe, of him≈øelfe, through him≈øelfe, and or him≈øelfe.

Goe then yee wi≈øe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Para≈øites, and erect Shrines, and offer ≈øacrifices to your God, the world, and ≈øeeke to plea≈øe him with your ba≈øe &amp; ≈øervile devotions: it ≈øhall be long enough ere ≈øuch religion ≈øhall make you happie: you ≈øhall at la≈øt for ≈øake tho≈øe Altars, emptie, and ≈øorrowfull; for, both you &amp; your God are beholding to a better being then your ≈øelues. How ridiculous is it to plead for an Idollgod that hath all the cau≈øes put vpon him. What fooles will be per≈øwaded to re≈øigne vp their owne eye-≈øight, and to looke thorow ≈øuch ≈øpectacles, as very ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe doth temper for them. I will her pre≈øume to pre≈ø≈øe in with an ea≈øie determination, although it ≈øeeme to me to be no other then a plaine quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3808:37"/>betweene ≈øtomacke, and di≈øcretion, a ≈ømall deale of wi≈øedome might decide it, e≈øpecially, con≈øidering that all things are from God, and God alone from him≈øelfe, Blu≈øh, ye Gentiles, that v≈øe a Smith, and Carpenter, ≈øo weake efficients, that they faint in drinking the ≈øtronge≈øt liquor. That make choyce of iron, bra≈ø≈øe, gold, ≈øilver, wood. &amp;c. as matter to matte the making of a God. But aboue all let them con≈øider, whom neither the fumes of ≈øie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pa≈ø≈øion do mi≈øt, nor ≈øini≈øter re≈øpects or preiudices ≈øway downe on either ≈øide, from the pitch of iu≈øt integritie: how ≈øilly and idle a thing it is to forme a God after the image of man, bird, or be≈øt, and that without the meane≈øt life, farre from any Deitie or Divinitie, except it be by the late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of the Mint, in the multitude of their moderne mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: but the Lord knowes, that the≈øe coines and ≈øtampes are farre off the pure≈øt pathes of veritie. Alas, how doe they ray and robbe God of his excellencie, whiles they robe him in the≈øe raggs of rotten relickes? But this is the very hate of heauen, and in effect, the very gate or hie way to hell, to giue our ≈øelues vnto it as our <hi>Summum Bomum,</hi> or chiefe good. Whiles <hi>Dagon</hi> ≈øtands, the <hi>Phili≈øtimes</hi> fall downe: but when <hi>Dagon</hi> was fallen before the <hi>Arke,</hi> the <hi>Phili≈øtimes</hi> ≈øtood to lift him vp. It is iu≈øt with God, that tho≈øe which want grace, ≈øhould want wit too; it is the power of ≈øuper≈øtision to turne men into tho≈øe ≈øtockes and ≈øtones, which they wor≈øhip. Methinkes their vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and wits ≈øhould haue waded further, if <hi>Dagon</hi> fall, how ≈øhall we ≈øtand by him? If he cannot helpe him≈øelfe, what ≈øhall he profit vs? Yet Idolatry and Super≈øtition are not ea≈øily put out of countenance; <hi>Dagon</hi> is vp againe, and the next morning (the fitte≈øt time for devotion) the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimes</hi> ha≈øten their ≈øpeed, and flocke to their Temple, to ≈øee how <hi>Dagon</hi> had re≈øted that night vnder his owne Roofe; and now behold in kindne≈ø≈øe their God is come to meeto them in the way; ≈øome peeces parted from the re≈øt ≈øalute them vpon the thre≈øhold; his head and his hands are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-runne their fellowes, to tell them, that neither his wit
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3808:37"/>nor his power could ≈øtand before the true God. And now whereas the thre≈øhold ≈øhould haue beene hollowed to the Victor; it is con≈øecrated to their beaten God. As if it had beene made more holy by his ruine, then Gods revenge. Therefore God ≈øtrikes them in their bodies, which could not feele them≈øelues ≈øtricken in their Idoll. Paine mu≈øt humble them, whom ≈øhame cannot. And now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to confe≈ø≈øe, that Gods hand was ≈øore vpon them, and their God. Yet they make account of confe≈ø≈øion as drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards doe of vomiting: the <hi>Arke</hi> of the God of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> ≈øhall not abide with them. Thus wicked men vpon all occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are glad to bee rid of God, but with no patience can part with their ≈øiunes. And thus the Prophet by running through all the cau≈øes, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 40.18. with 44.12. derides the Heathen by making their gods. And then, as if they were be≈øotted, askes them, <hi>Haue yee not knowne? Haue yee not heard? Hath it not beene told you from the beginning? Haue yee not vnder≈øtood it from the foundations of the earth? It is be that is God, which is able to ≈øit vpon he circle of the earth: ≈øtretch the heavens as a Curtains, and ≈øpread them as a Tert to dwell in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence, that God is without all cau≈øes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Fir≈øt, <hi>He is without an efficient, or beginning.</hi> Rev. 1.8. <hi>and</hi> 3.14. And from hence he is not ≈øubiect or obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>creation,</hi> or <hi>annihilation</hi> of any other, as are ll creatures; yea, the very Angels; and therefore God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely independent, and ≈øupreame. And here nature and good nature may bring vs to God. Rea≈øon hath no where either bound or banke to re≈øtraine it, but at this cau≈øe, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it bring vs, and here will it leaue vs. <hi>I am the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creatures,</hi> ≈øayth Chri≈øt; therefore God: goe by the creatures as workes, and they will lead vs to their fir≈øt efficient and beginning. Secondly, <hi>God is without all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and therefore mo≈øt <hi>≈øpirituall:</hi> the le≈ø≈øe matter, and the more forme the creatures inioy, the more ≈øpirituall it makes them. By God therefore, ≈øo pure a ≈øpirit, are all things nouri≈øhed with the onely dew of divine benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but this high way is ≈øo plaine, that a guide were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3808:38"/>Furthermore, God being mo≈øt ≈øpirituall, is likewi≈øe mo≈øt <hi>invi≈øible,</hi> and <hi>impalpable.</hi> Too ≈øubtile for ≈øinew or ≈øight to ≈øea≈øe vpon him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. It would pre≈øent him for a furious and raving Bedlam, that ≈øhould once formalize God to his owne fancies. Againe, where matter is wanting, there <hi>common nature</hi> is wanting; for, things communicate, as they ri≈øe from ≈øome common ≈øtocke, and ≈øtemme. And becau≈øe all ≈øpecialls are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder generalls, God wants that too; and therefore is properly, neither e≈ø≈øence, or being: but an <hi>Huperou≈øios,</hi> or <hi>≈øuper ≈øub≈øtantiall</hi> being by him≈øelfe, one onely in number, neither dividing, nor devided; multiplying, or multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The wife is the husband devided, and the childe is the father multiplied. But God is neither ≈øo devided into three, neither are three ≈øo multiplied from one. He is (if I may ≈øo ≈øpeake with reverence) without all ≈øtocke or kine. Therefore when we ≈øay, e≈ø≈øence is common, and per≈øon proper, it mu≈øt be receiued with a graine of ≈øalt. For the common nature is not di≈øtributed into parts, as into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; but as common to all, ≈øo it is one individuall and ≈øingular e≈ø≈øence in them all, and that receiued of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon without parts or pa≈ø≈øions; for, matter is the ground of both, and where that is wanting, they are not to bee found. I ≈øtay the longer vpon the≈øe Negatiues, becau≈øe we re not loo≈øely &amp; lightly to ≈ølide over the things of God, as if they were vulgar, and triviall, like our owne. Thus farre you haue ≈øeene God, out of the rode and reach of the efficient, and matter: ≈øee him now voyd of forme and end; for in them likewi≈øe con≈øi≈øts power to be. The <hi>forme</hi> in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comming is the cau≈øe of all <hi>generation</hi> and <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> God therefore being without it, is <hi>incorruptible,</hi> and therefore a God <hi>immortall</hi> and <hi>everla≈øting.</hi> P≈øal. 102.26.27. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. A choice and refined peece of high Quinte≈ø≈øence of wit is that of Papi≈øts in their breaden god, which yet never Church could di≈øtill out of her braines, or a≈øpire vnto, be≈øides their owne. What genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption doe they make of the everla≈øting
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3808:38"/>bread of heauen? Here perhaps might wee finde ≈øtuffe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (I will not ≈øay to lade an <hi>Argo≈øie</hi>) but to over lade any mans wit in the world to reply vnto. It ≈øhall ≈øuffice vs to thinke of God as God, and man as man. Chri≈øt in heaven, and Chri≈øt in the Sacrament. Now if wee adde further, without both matter and forme together, then is God neither the <hi>whole,</hi> nor the <hi>member</hi> of any thing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to be di≈øtributed or defined; I meane with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect definition; becau≈øe he hath no e≈ø≈øence diver≈øe from him≈øelfe, and therefore the definition, and that which it defines, are all one: ≈øo, that in God <hi>Thees</hi> and <hi>Theiotees, God</hi> and the <hi>God-head</hi> are all one. La≈øtly, hauing neither matter, nor forme, he wants all terms and limitations of e≈ø≈øence, and therefore as mo≈øt ≈øimple, ≈øo mo≈øt infinite in being. For <hi>end,</hi> God is endle≈ø≈øe, being neither for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or hauing any other better then him≈øelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>chiefe good,</hi> and by communication <hi>our good,</hi> and ≈øo to be de≈øired aboue all. <hi>Math.</hi> 19.17. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 63.7.11 <hi>and</hi> 73.25. <hi>and</hi> 18.1.2. How ea≈øie is it now for Chri≈øtians to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult over worldlings, that thinke them≈øelues worthy of enuie? and to turne off their darling with a ≈øcornefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øe?

               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence, that God is without accidents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he is both Apo≈øes,</hi> without quantitie, and <hi>Apoios</hi> without qualitie. In regard of the fir≈øt, hee is neither aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented nor dimini≈øhed; of the ≈øecond, neither altered nor changed. <hi>Euen to your old age I am he, and euen to heare haires will I carry you.</hi> I≈øa. 46.4. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not: therefore yee ≈øonnes of Iacob are not con≈øumed. Mal.</hi> 3.6. By this I ≈øee that all things here below are as farre from ≈øince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as continuance, if they were ≈øweete, as the ioyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, yet how ≈øhould their ficklene≈ø≈øe coole our delights, and make vs e≈øteeme the≈øe drams of honey lo≈øt in pounds of gall, and guile? We laugh at their choice that are in loue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3808:39"/>with the deformed; and what a face is this we now dove vpon? See if our ≈øinnes, cares, and cro≈ø≈øes haue not like a filthy morphew over-≈øpread it; and made it loath≈øome (in compari≈øon of the beautie of the Creator) to all iudicious eyes. I marvaile then that we ≈øhould thus loue, what woe cannot hold, and for a ≈øhadow of a ≈ømoake, and a dreame of a ≈øhadow leaue him, who≈øe light is neither variable, nor ≈øhadowed with turning. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. Here then, if wee will be wi≈øe Marchants, thri≈øtie and happie v≈øurers, let vs part with that which wee can nor keepe, that we may gaine him whom wee cannot loo≈øe. The≈øe cottages of ours haue beene ruinous a long time, and the wor≈øe for their acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and yet like fooles wee haue not thought of their fall. Lord giue mee grace to leane vpon thee, then ≈øhall my fall be ea≈øie, and my re≈øt endle≈ø≈øe. Oh, thou which art out of the power of others, over power mee to the obedience of thy ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What will follow from Gods e≈ø≈øence in the la≈øt place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God is one mo≈øt pure and meere act;</hi> that is, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and action are all one thing. For as his e≈ø≈øence is ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ≈øo is his working. There is never a creature but hee worketh by qualities, and ≈øo his act is fir≈øt in the power of them. The fire warmes not without heat, neither doth man vnder≈øtand without rea≈øon: a Bird might as ea≈øily flee without wings, and fire a≈øcend without lightne≈ø≈øe, as the creature produce his actions without facultie and power thereunto. And hereupon it followeth, that pa≈ø≈øion and re≈øi≈øtence are incident to all his workes. The very Deuils ≈øuffer, and are re≈øi≈øted of God, and how ≈øoever their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too ≈øwift to be ≈øtricken, or ≈ølayed by corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments, yet God is quicke enough for them, to make them both feele and feare the dint of his ≈øword. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ≈øo ab≈øolute an act, mu≈øt needs haue his being and doing all one.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I worke,</hi> which ≈øhewes, that Gods act is eternall; and ≈øo creation as an act is from God, hath no beginning, as a pa≈ø≈øion in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is mea≈øured by time. In regard of the fir≈øt wee call
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3808:39"/>him a pure and meere act. In regard of the ≈øecond, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, being able to make nothing as well as ≈øome thing, feele his worke which before could not be perceiued. And therefore omnipotencie, or Almightie power is not giuen to God in regard of him≈øelfe, but his creatures, which may feele that hand which before was vnfelt. Againe, Gods being and act being all one thing, hee mu≈øt needs doe all things by his e≈ø≈øence, which is purely one. Hence God is the Archetype, or fir≈øt draught of euery eminent act. In which re≈øpect it mu≈øt needs be of ≈øoueraigne v≈øe for the di≈øcouering and reforming of what≈øoeuer error time hath ≈øoyled his actions withall. How are defaced copies, and di≈ø≈øigured pictures better amended, then by reducing them to their originall? If the pipe fayle, goe wee not to the head? O that his acts were ≈øet as a frontlet betweene the eyes, &amp; as a ≈øeale vpon the hearts of all his followers. Ought not all our actions to be as branches of this root? Surely, this is the cleare head-≈øpring of all other en≈øuing brookes; and as little ≈øtreames empty them≈øelues into great rivers; and they againe into the Sea; ≈øo mu≈øt all runne to this maine. Venerable it is for the very antiquitie of it.

                  <hi>In that he hath made him≈øelfe many attributes.</hi> It is fit that the obiect and the vnder≈øtanding be proportionable to it ≈øelfe, an infinite vnder≈øtanding is capable of an infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and ≈øo God onely vnder≈øtands him≈øelfe. Now becau≈øe man cannot apprehend God by one act of vnder≈øtanding, the ≈øimplicitie of his face and e≈ø≈øence is layd open by the multiplicitie of his backe-parts, and attributes.

               <p>Q. <hi>What are Gods Attributes?</hi>

                  <hi>the Lord thy God is one, great, mightie, terrible, &amp;c.</hi> Faith, which is the divine <hi>Logick</hi> of Gods ≈øpirit, re≈øts vpon te≈øtimony aboue all Arguments, and ≈øo takes God barely on his word, without any further di≈øcour≈øe: yet by the way of vnder≈øtanding, which apprehends the knowledge of things by Arguments, di≈øtinct from the things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them≈øelues, Faith is ≈øo farre content that Rea≈øon ≈øhew the way, in making the Attributes diver≈øe from the e≈ø≈øence, and among≈øt them≈øelues; but checks rea≈øon when it would make them oppo≈øite, or really to be di≈øtingui≈øhed. It is aboue the Art of rea≈øon to teach the ≈øubiect and all his attributes to be one in nature; and yet thus farre it may agree with rea≈øon, to make them diver≈øe. So that by faith and the way of ≈øanctified rea≈øon, wee come to apprehend him that is ≈øimply one. Mans rea≈øon in matter of faith, as fire in the fir≈øt degree of her a≈øcent may be a flame, next ≈ømoake, and then nothing. The light may be good, if like <hi>fooles-fire</hi> wee tru≈øt it not too long. Faith ≈øtands like an auncient <hi>Pyramid;</hi> which the le≈ø≈øe it growes to a mans eye, the neerer it reaches to heauen. Whereas rea≈øon for the mo≈øt part, like <hi>A≈øtronomie</hi> begins in Nature, ends in Magicke. If it may haue the whole handling of divinitie, it will make it ridiculous before it leaue it. <hi>Logicke,</hi> the <hi>Heraldry</hi> of all Arts, and the be≈øt array of indgement, is in the mo≈øt exact knowledge of God, either a skilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or a wild knowledge.

And ≈øeeing God hath made the ≈øoule as the lampe of the body, and rea≈øon as the lampe of the ≈øoule; Religion of Rea≈øon, and Faith of Religion: Let vs v≈øe all the≈øe lights without confu≈øion, and let not one trip vp the heeles of the other, according to the dexteritie of humane policy.

In euery creature there is a compo≈øition of matter and forme, out of which it hath his e≈ø≈øence and action: ≈øo in God, ≈øpirit is as the matter, life as the forme; I ≈øay expre≈ø≈øing, not compounding his nature.

Earth is more gro≈ø≈øe then water; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ayre; ayre then fire; bodies then ≈øoules; men then Angels; Angels then God.

                  <hi>that thou mighte≈øt know, that the Lord he is God; there is none el≈øe be≈øide him. Thou ha≈øt ≈øaid the truth: for there is one God, and there is no other but he. Though many are called Gods, yet to vs there is but one God.</hi> Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we need not be di≈øtracted in the wor≈øhip of this our God. Let him carry vs which way hee will, make the pa≈ø≈øages never ≈øo trouble≈øome and perillous, yet the ≈øame hand that makes them hard will make them ≈øure, and if we be faithfull to him, he will ma≈øter all difficulties for vs. O God as wee haue tru≈øted thee with the beginning, ≈øo will wee tru≈øt thee with the fini≈øhing of our glory. And though never ≈øo many or maine hinderances of our ≈øaluation offer them≈øelues, and after all our hopes, threaten to defeat vs, yet faithfull art thou that ha≈øt promi≈øed, which wilt al≈øo doe it. For how ≈øhould≈øt thou that art one in number and e≈ø≈øence, be otherwi≈øe then thy ≈øelfe. All things doe turne vpon this poynt, and ha≈øten to this center: if it were not for vnitie, multiplicitie would de≈øtroy it ≈øelfe. Nature will runne out of it ≈øelfe to doe homage to this vniforme crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>What ayled thee O Sea, that thou fledde≈øt, and thou Iordan, that thou wa≈øt driuen backe? yee mountaines that yee leaped like Rammes, and yee little hills like Lombes?

What a rowe of creatures follow thee, and what an Army doe≈øt thou lead? In ≈øpite of all Athei≈øts, vnitie will Mar≈øhall all vnder thy colours; and let them die by Mar≈øhall law that dare once breake this ranke, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liou≈øly ≈øet them≈øelues again≈øt thee. There were no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers if thou wert not fir≈øt, and if there be many, thou art a God: No A thei≈øt in the world ≈øhall be able to phillip off this authoritie with di≈ødaine. God is the fir≈øt, becau≈øe in nature one is before two, and mu≈øt begin in the order of computation. Account the times, and tell mee who hath multiplied them?

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods infinitene≈ø≈øe?</hi>

A ≈øonne feeling the loue of his father, creepes neerer vnder his wings, or elbow: how ea≈øie is it for God to enter our ≈øtony and ≈øteely hearts, and draw them after him? They that re≈øi≈øt the holy Gho≈øt, doe it by gain-≈øaying his word, not by fru≈øtrating his worke; for hee ≈øhall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the world.</hi> Io. 16.8. either to conver≈øion, or confu≈øion.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3808:47"/>The altitude of pride, longitude of power, and profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of policie are trampled vpon by God. Proud <hi>Bel≈øhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> (Dan. 5.27.) <hi>was weighed and found too light;</hi> Gods wand ≈øoone found him wanting; and alas, how ea≈øily did God penetrate the hard walls of his heart, to the horrour of his whole ≈øoule, and ha≈øtning of his death? Now as a Ship in the mid≈øt of a ≈øtorme, to≈ø≈øed with tempe≈øts, and beaten on every ≈øide, with windes and waues, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly driuen, not by direction of the Ma≈øter, but by the fury of vnbridled violence; ≈øo, in this extraordinary agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Rea≈øon, which is the Pilote, could beare no Rule; but affection and affliction, as a ≈øtorme, to≈ø≈øe and driue him to vtter de≈øpaire. Thus all the wicked, who≈øe hearts the Lord doth not pear≈øe and boare by his word, he enters by force to ≈øtirre vp that raging Sea, who≈øe waters foame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mire and gravell. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What in the ≈øecond place may be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His incomprehen≈øiblene≈ø≈øe, whereby hee is without all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of place,</hi> and from this flowes his <hi>omnipre≈øence,</hi> or <hi>vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,</hi> whereby he is wholly without and within all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place, no where included, no where excluded; and that without all locall motion, or mutation of place. Hee fils al places without compre≈ø≈øion, or ≈øtraitning of another, or the contraction, exten≈øion, conden≈øation, or rarefaction of him≈øelfe.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3808:48"/>but God at a blu≈øh fills all places, to comfort or confound, as it plea≈øeth him.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods eternitie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That whereby he is before and after all, not beings:</hi> that is, not onely the world, but the very nothing of it. Rea≈øon will teach me that nothing was before the world, and that nothing may be after it: but it cannot teach mee any ≈øuch apprehen≈øion before or after God. For I cannot ≈øo much as conceiue a nothing, before an ab≈øolute being: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is becau≈øe nothing is apprehended by way of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie to ≈øomething. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Before the mountaines were made, &amp;c.</hi> God is not onely before the creature, but the making of it, and that from an everla≈øting before it, to an everla≈øting after it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 139.16. God ≈øees the creature in his <hi>non entitie,</hi> or nothing. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>He inhabiteth eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The King of ages.</hi> Heb. 1.2. <hi>The maker of times.</hi> The Hebrew word comes of a roote, to he hid, becau≈øe there is no knowledge where to beginne or end. Alas, how doe wee affect a thou≈øand things that cannot be effected; mi≈øerably afflicting the ≈øoule becau≈øe they are wanting. And of all things wee doe obtaine, the plea≈øure doth forth with eyther vani≈øh, or cloy; they doe no more ≈øatisfie the appetite, then ≈øalt water quencheth thir≈øt. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this eternall God giues it all contentment. Eternitie is eyther an admirable ble≈ø≈øing, or a mi≈øerable cur≈øe. If all the puni≈øhments of hell were no greater then the ≈øtinging of Gnatts, perpetuity is enough to make them intolerable. Oh, how grievous ≈øhall it bee to the damned, to thinke,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3808:48"/>that after millions of ages, the ≈øhall bee ≈øo farre eyther from end, or from ea≈øe, as they were the fir≈øt day of their beginning. In life there is ≈øome ea≈øe, and in death an end: but here the wicked ≈øhall neither haue end, nor ea≈øe. So long as God ≈øhall liue, ≈øo long ≈øhall the damned die; and when he ≈øhall cea≈øe to be happy, then ≈øhall they al≈øo cea≈øe to bee mi≈øerable.</p>

All creatures haue a la≈øting: Angels an out-la≈øting; God an ever-la≈øting.

Alas, that ever ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cold windes of temptation, ≈øhould blow betwixt God and our hearts, to make our affections cooler vnto him.

               <p>Q. <hi>What ≈øecondly may we learne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the acts of the≈øe qualities differ nothing from the qualities them≈øelues, nor they from the e≈ø≈øence, or among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, but onely in re≈øpect of our vnder≈øtanding, which doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øely apprehend them.</hi> Exod. 3.14. <hi>I am,</hi> mu≈øt ever be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved as a rule to keepe vs from gro≈ø≈øe conceits of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I worke.</hi> Euery creature hath his being before his action, but in God e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, facultie, vertue, and action are altogether, and the ≈øame. So that it is good re≈øting vpon him, in whom is ≈øo great perfection as to be ≈øimply one, and vertually all things. I can wonder at nothing more, then how a man can be idle; but of all other a Chri≈øtian; in ≈øo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouements of rea≈øon, in ≈øuch ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of knowledge, in ≈øuch varietie of contemplations, and mo≈øt happie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of thoughts. Other <hi>Artizans</hi> and <hi>Schollers</hi> doe but practi≈øe, we ≈øtill learne; others runne ≈øtill in the ≈øame gyre, to wearine≈ø≈øe, to ≈øatietie, our choice is infinite: how many bu≈øie tongues cha≈øe away good houres in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant

Who would not wi≈øh him≈øelfe an <hi>Anachoret,</hi> ≈øecluded from the world, and pent vp in the voluntary pri≈øon-walles of his daily thoughts of God? Let vs therefore in our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on his back-parts, and the≈øe his mo≈øt excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, take heed how we begin our heauenly thoughts, and pro≈øecute them not. Hee that kindles a fire vnder greene wood, and leaues it, ≈øo ≈øoone as it begins but to flame, mu≈øt needs finde it cleane out, when hee would warme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe by it: ≈øo, if we begin to thinke the≈øe thoughts, and giue over, wee cannot but loo≈øe by them, becau≈øe they are not ≈øeconded by ≈øutable proceedings. Fire in embers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtirred, glowes not, heats not the hou≈øe. Sugar in the cup vn≈øtirred, ≈øweetens not the wine. It is not a Trade, but a Trade well followed that fills the pur≈øe. It is not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of land, but land well-looked too, that maintaines the man. A locke without a key, is of no v≈øe: ≈øo, there is no profit in ≈øetting our ≈øelues to meditate on God, more then of a ≈øleeping habite, if wee giue over before wee come to ≈øome i≈ø≈øue.</p>

And hereby it mu≈øt follow, that God is mo≈øt actiue, wanting no abilitie for the effecting of any thing. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.40. <hi>God in power lifts vp his hand to heaven, and ≈øayes, I liue for euer.</hi> Io≈øh. 3.10. The liuing God is knowne to be among the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> by his powerfull driuing out of the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Ier. 10.10.14. Becau≈øe of his life and everla≈øting ne≈ø≈øe, <hi>the earth ≈øhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 4.34. and 6.26. Ioh. 1.4. Act. 17.28. I. Pet. 1.23. Rev. 15.7. If fortie dayes raine, driuen with the tempe≈øt of Gods wrath, was ≈øufficient to de≈øtroy the whole world; what ≈øhall we e≈øteeme of the full ≈øtorme &amp; ≈øtreame of his rage, wherein the fiery darts of his fury, ≈øhall never cea≈øe to beate vpon his enemies? He ≈øurely, that ca≈øts off this God, ca≈øts away him≈øelfe; and being the abiect of God, mu≈øt needs be the ≈øubiect of the Devill. But for his elect, and their ≈øalvation, hee ≈øhall ≈øtriue with no greater ≈øtraine in effecting their good, then we doe in the motion of our eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the kinds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Vnder≈øtanding</hi> and <hi>will:</hi> the be≈øt faculties in which life doth mo≈øt eminently ≈øhew it ≈øelfe, are giuen to GOD. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. God vnder≈øtands the very inwards, and his will is to ca≈øt them off, that care not for him. Oh, thou which art the be≈øt vnder≈øtanding, and the pure≈øt will, poli≈øh thou the two tables of my ≈øoule, my vnder≈øtanding and my will; this of affections, the other of cogitations,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3808:53"/>that I may both thinke and will as thou woulde≈øt haue mee.

Manife≈øt things need no other iudgement, then the very ≈øight and ≈øound of them. Now to this intelligent God all things are <hi>layd open and naked.</hi> Heb. 4.13. Hee is no wayes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by compo≈øition or divi≈øion, or any manner of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi≈øticall di≈øcour≈øe.

O thou that ha≈øt pure eyes looke vpon vs in thy Sonne, and ≈øo wee ≈øhall neither bee dazeled, nor damned. Eye ≈øeruice is a fault with men: but if wee could but ≈øerue God while he ≈øees vs, it were enough. Hee ≈øees them that will be Saints in the Church, and Ruffians in the Taverne, Tyrants in their hou≈øes, and Cheators in their ≈øhops. He ≈øees tho≈øe daintie Dames that vnder a cloke of mode≈øty and devotion, can hide their pride and fiendi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. It will not be long, ere thou wilt iudge all our ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecies with ≈øeveritie. The ≈øunne of my ≈øinnefull life hath pa≈ø≈øed the meridian, and I am now in the after-noone of my age. The night of nature will come fa≈øt vpon mee: when death (as Gods ≈øergeant) will arre≈øt my body vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debt due vnto nature, my ≈øoule vpon tre≈øpa≈ø≈øe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again≈øt my all-≈øeeing Creator.

Onely this is my ≈øtay and ≈øtaffe, that hee will both forgiue and forget, yea, put him≈øelfe out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, if I betimes judge my ≈øelfe, and repent of my evill.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What as his Will?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>That whereby he wills mo≈øt freely what is good.</hi> Exod. 33.19. P≈øal. 5.4. <hi>and</hi> 115.3. <hi>and</hi> 135.6. And here might ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ≈øayd of diver≈øe affections attributed to God. But they will appeare better vpon the occa≈øions they manife≈øt them≈øelues, and for which they are giuen to God. And here mu≈øt wee learne our coun≈øell, and comfort. Coun≈øell to ≈øubmit to what≈øoeuer he commandeth; and comfort to admit what≈øoever he promi≈øeth. Oh, vaine ≈øtudies of men, how to walke thorow ≈øtreets all day in the ≈øhade, how to ≈øquare circles, how to ≈øalue the cele≈øtiall motions, how to correct mi≈øhapen copies, to fetch vp old words from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulne≈ø≈øe, and a thou≈øand other points of idle skill; whiles the maine care of knowing Gods will is neglected. This makes the be≈øt of all the≈øe inferiour creatures, to liue in more ≈øorrow and di≈øcontentment then the wor≈øt of them; yea, that very rea≈øon wherein he excells them, &amp; by which he might advantage his life, is abu≈øed to ≈øu≈øpicious di≈øtru≈øt of God and his will. How many haue wee found of the fowles of the ayre lying dead in our way for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion? they can eate, re≈øt, ≈øing, &amp;c. onely man toyleth, careth, loatheth, and lamenteth his pre≈øent; O the coldnes of care in ca≈øting it vpon God, as if he wanted will to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide be≈øt for them, for whom he hath prouided all things.

               <p>A. <hi>The qualities whereby he is ab≈øolutely good</hi> Math. 19.17. <hi>Why calle≈øt thou me good, there is none goad but God.</hi> Deut. 32.4.

               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Gods mo≈øt ab≈øolute happine≈ø≈øe both in action and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi> Whereby he is freed from all evill, abounding with all good, ≈øufficiently contenting him≈øelfe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and no wayes ≈øtanding in need of any other. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. <hi>and</hi> 6.15.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>vnd</hi> 50.7. to 14. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.8. Behold now yee ambitious ≈øpirits, how ye may truely ri≈øe to more then ever the ≈øonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> de≈øired to a≈øpire vnto. Waiting is the way to raigning, ≈øerue him which is thus happy, though without apparent wages: he will pay ≈øure, if ≈ølow. Liue well, and thou maye≈øt liue in expectation, as tho≈øe which after ≈øome terme of their cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage expired, are a≈ø≈øured they ≈øhall haue a marble palace built for them. O let vs thinke that the dayes and moneths pa≈ø≈øe ≈ølowly away, till then, ever looking vp to him that is the fini≈øher of our faith, and remembring that for the new heavens, our hearts mu≈øt be made new before hand. Let worldlings, like a company of idle boyes, ≈øcramble for the figges of this life; it is for wi≈øe men to take them if they fall in their bo≈øomes: who≈øe maine care is to be found acceptable in the day of the Lord. Worldly vanities (which are alwayes ther owne cut-throats, by their owne cro≈ø≈øing and contrarietie) are to be abandoned of Chri≈øtians, who ca≈øting away all weake diffidences, know how to tru≈øt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3808:56"/>God with his owne. <hi>Waite thou on the Lord, and keepe his way, and he ≈øhall exalt thee.</hi> P≈øal. 37.34. <hi>It is he that will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all the good plea≈øure of his goodne≈ø≈øe, and the worke of faith with power.</hi> 2. The≈ø≈ø. 1.11. O that hee would purge out of our minds and memories that ambition and vanitie, which ≈øo bewitches them with the loue of pompes and glories of this peri≈øhing and ending world, which in the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a breath, wee may loath, loo≈øe, leaue and de≈øpi≈øe as nothing: and would graffe in them a pure and ≈øingle eye, to behold the eternall bli≈ø≈øe, which ≈øeene, breedeth loue, and loued conducts vs to heaven. Here to as high a tide as wee ≈øhall ri≈øe in our de≈øires of wealth, and well-fare, to as low an ebbe ≈øhall we fall in our hopes thereof. <hi>Seeing then we looke for better things in the heavens, let vs be diligent that we may be found of him in peace, without ≈øpot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe.</hi> 2. Pet. 3.14. Doe wee beleeue that all things ≈øhall be made new, and our hearts onely remaine olde? As if our ble≈ø≈øed God, intended nothing but our ≈øoules to be out of fa≈øhion. Be a≈ø≈øured, that as no man <hi>puts new wine into olde ve≈ø≈øels, no more will God put the new wine of his glory, into the olde ve≈ølels of our corruption.</hi> Looke wee therefore to him, that hath ≈øayd he will giue vs new hearts. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. And remember that all our glory begins in grace, and that God will haue none to dwell with him in happine≈ø≈øe, that will not vouch≈øafe him to dwell with them in holine≈ø≈øe. Roote out (deare God) all gall and acerbitie among≈øt brethren, and bend their hearts to charitie, that being re-vnited in the pilgrimage of this life, this country of our terre≈øtriall, bodies, wee may after our ≈øervice and cour≈øe therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed, a≈øcend vnder the conduct of our Sauiour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a≈øcended to our everla≈øting re≈øt, in the countrey of our cele≈øtiall Soules, there in ≈øocietie and vnitie of Saints and Angels, to enioy the happy vi≈øion of the all-glorious Deitie, and to ≈øing his pray≈øe for ever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>An≈øwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That one mo≈øt pure e≈ø≈øence, with the relatiue properties.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation addes nothing to the divine e≈ø≈øence, but re≈øpect, or mutuall affection. God with the relation of begetting is the Father, of begotten the Sonne, of proceeding the Spirit. One and the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence hath all the≈øe re≈øpects: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure wee haue mi≈ø-taken our Cue; for there is not ≈øo much in the divine e≈ø≈øence as any inherent qualitie. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, I marvaile ≈øo learned a di≈øputer ≈øhould moote no better. Qualitie and relation are di≈øtinct predicaments. Wi≈øedome and father-hood in the ≈øame man, are not two qualities; for the one, becau≈øe a qualitie, is ≈øome thing in it ≈øelfe; but the other, becau≈øe a relatiue, is nothing without another. A father is nothing without a ≈øonne, neither is the ≈øonne in being without a father. They are mutuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And yet one being may be mutually many of them; as one and the ≈øelfe ≈øame man, may be a father, a ma≈øter, and a ≈øubiect: ≈øo, one pure God may be a father, ≈øonne, and holy Gho≈øt. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. Wee call them Sub≈øi≈øtences, becau≈øe by their ≈øingular, individuall, and per≈øonall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, they ≈øub≈øi≈øt in one and the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence. Could we now but through a crevis, or lettice, ≈øee tho≈øe things which the eye of faith ≈øeeth here with open face, how would wee loath all Epicuri≈øme and Athei≈øme, in compari≈øon of our Bapti≈øme in the name of the≈øe three worthies? Had we but ta≈øted with the tip of our tongues the≈øe dainties, we would pray with <hi>Dauid</hi> even again≈øt the <hi>worlds delicates,</hi> P≈øal. 141.4. Here ≈øhall wee not haue our liues compo≈øed of ieiune
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3808:57"/>and emptie contemplations, but ≈øo full of contentment, that wee ≈øhall need to wi≈øh no other mea≈øure of plea≈øure, then to be wholly taken vp with this divine taske. Here is the exaltation of <hi>I≈øaacs</hi> delight in walking forth into the plea≈øant fields of ≈øacred meditations, on the ble≈ø≈øed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. O let our Soules haue two or three walkes a day vpon this <hi>mount Taber,</hi> and with holy <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> conuer≈øe with one God in three per≈øons, on the <hi>Horeb</hi> of both Te≈øtaments, till wee haue found out vnto our ≈øelues the pure law of life. As the≈øe three exhibite it vnto vs. And if the one bre≈øt let not downe this nouri≈øhing liquor ≈øo freely, ≈øo ea≈øily, as our ≈øtrength will beare it, then may we refre≈øh our ≈øelues with the other, and by ≈øuch a ≈ømall varietie wee ≈øhall finde them yeelde milke equally whole≈øome, equally plea≈øant to vs weake Infants and nur≈øelings. If mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> covered with darkene≈ø≈øe, tremble, the father being offended: the Go≈øpell calmes and lightens it pre≈øently, the ≈øonne hauing ≈øatisfied.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is eternall life, to know the father reconciled in his ≈øonne.</hi> Retire thy ≈øelfe daily into ≈øome ≈øecret place of meditation, and prayer, ≈øuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> his leaddes, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> clo≈øet, &amp;c. and thou ≈øhalt finde with <hi>Iacob</hi> the ≈øweete vi≈øion of Angels, climbing vp and downe this ≈øacred lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ≈øtands betwixt heauen and earth, at the top of it is the father, the whole length of it is in the ≈øonne, and the ≈øpirit doth firmely fa≈øten vs thereunto, that ≈øo we may be tran≈øported vnto bli≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is here to be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>names</hi> in Scripture that expre≈ø≈øe this my≈øtery, as <hi>Elohim,</hi> and <hi>Adonai.</hi> Gen. 1.1. Mal. 1.6. Both which words being plurall, are ioyned with words of the ≈øingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number: to ≈øhew the vnitie of the per≈øons, both in e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, and action. It is not for euery proflygate profe≈ø≈øor that liues as he li≈øt, to be dealing with this divinitie. The≈øe pearles are not for ≈øwine, who will laugh at ≈øuch congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as makes one of three, and three of one: but hee that findes and feeles the conioyned working of the Trinitie, will adore it in vnitie, a≈øcribing to father, ≈øonne, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3808:57"/>Gho≈øt equall authoritie and power in all their workes. This (as well as the whole rule of well-liuing) belongs to the ≈øealed fountaine, the ≈øpou≈øe of Chri≈øt. A doctrine not fit to be preached in <hi>Gath</hi> &amp; <hi>A≈økelon,</hi> to vncircumci≈øed and prophane hearts, that will turne euery good thing to their owne de≈øtruction. The Lord that hath the teaching of all hearts, make vs ready for this tran≈øcendent learning.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ≈øecondly is to be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the ≈øub≈øi≈øtences, or per≈øons, being the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence, are God, and one God.</hi> Ioh. 1.1. 1. Ioh. 5.7. Cut but the hayre from the eye brow (≈øaith <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi>) and how di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured will the face looke, there is but a ≈ømall thing taken from the body, but a greater matter from the beautie: ≈øo in the≈øe honourable wayes of wi≈øedome, wee may not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the lea≈øt iot of Deitie or dignitie from any per≈øon.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What in the third place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That what≈øoeuer Attribute is giuen to the e≈ø≈øence, may ≈øo farre forth be giuen to the ≈øub≈øi≈øtences:</hi> as euery per≈øon is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternall, incomprehen≈øible, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. with 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9 Chri≈øt hath the ≈øame name and authoritie with his Father. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.2. <hi>and</hi> 14.1. <hi>and</hi> 21.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. In all the≈øe places, the e≈ø≈øentiall Attributes of the divine nature are giuen to Chri≈øt. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe to the Spirit. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 139. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3.4. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Iob</hi> 33.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19. O that we had but in vs the internall principles of faith, to re≈øt vpon the≈øe three worthies, infinitely great and gracious. This I am ≈øure, as a ≈øpring, or oyle to the wheeles of our Soules, would make them goe ≈ømoothly, and currantly. Make all other yokes light and ea≈øie. Vndoubtedly, the Pipe of Faith would here draw in ≈øo much ≈øweete ayre from the precious promi≈øes of life, that thereby wee ≈øhould be able <hi>to renue our ≈øtrength, and with chearefull ≈øpirits lift vp the wing as the Eagle, runne and not be weary, walke and not faint.</hi> What, ≈øhall idle Guls with a Pipe of Tobacco, or Cup of Sacke, (≈øilly ≈ømoakie helpes) giue life againe to their dull and deadly Spirits? And ≈øhall not the Saints and ≈øervants of three ≈øo infinite,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3808:58"/>exhilerate and cheare their hearts, with the feeling of their new life, ≈øo mercifully begun by the father, powerfully di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by the ≈øonne, and perfectly fini≈øhed by the ≈øpirit? Where were all this grace, if it were not ≈øtronger then any <hi>Ellebore,</hi> to evacuate the minde of all feares and griefes? It is for nature to be ≈øubiect to extremities, that is, eyther too dull in want, or wanton in fruition; but grace like a good temper is not ≈øen≈øible of alteration. O then that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ea≈øie occa≈øion of plea≈øure, profit, or preferment, ≈øhould interrupt vs in the≈øe religious intentions, and draw vs to gaze, like children, which if a bird doe but flie in their way, ca≈øt their eye from their Booke. Nay, what a ≈øhame is it to thinke, how hardly we are drawne to learne or li≈øten to this le≈ø≈øon? As a beare to the ≈øtake, as a ≈ølaue to the mill, or a dullard to the Schoole, are wee brought to the≈øe ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What in the fourth place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That all the three per≈øons are God of them≈øelues;</hi> for an ab≈øolute fir≈øt cannot, no not in order, be the ≈øecond, or third of any other: but a fir≈øt in all. The Sonne becau≈øe he hath his per≈øon from the Father, is a ≈øecond per≈øon, but not a ≈øecond God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. All tho≈øe places that proue God to be one, exclude all deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of e≈ø≈øence, for one cannot bee multiplied without number. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The ≈øonne is the image of the per≈øon, not the e≈ø≈øence; it were an ab≈øurditie to ≈øay, Chri≈øt is the image of him≈øelfe: but apt and proper the expre≈ø≈øe image of his Father. For tho he be no other thing from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet another per≈øon. Hence wee learne how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that ≈øpeech, <hi>very God of very God,</hi> that is, the ≈øub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtence of the ≈øonne is verily and truly from the ≈øub≈øi≈øtence of the father. The per≈øon begetts, not the e≈ø≈øence; for, to beget, and be begotten, are relatiues, yet the e≈ø≈øence is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute. But <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.26. <hi>It is giuen to Chri≈øt to haue life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe.</hi> If life, then e≈ø≈øence, &amp;c. I an≈øwere, Chri≈øt ≈øpeakes of life in the text by way of di≈øpen≈øation, as he was the <hi>Me≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and ≈øo it is explained, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>He hath giuen him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3808:58"/>to execute Iudgement, becau≈øe he is the ≈øonne of man.</hi> The very text makes this common to both per≈øons, <hi>to haue life in them≈øelues,</hi> which is the property of the God-head: and yet Chri≈øt hauing life in him≈øelfe as God, hath the ≈øame gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, as Mediator, and ≈øonne of man: but you will ≈øay, ≈øo he had power to giue him≈øelfe life, and therefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giuing re≈øpects his per≈øon as well as his office. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, it is true, for as the ≈øonne of man receiues ≈øub≈øi≈øtence from the ≈øonne of God, ≈øo the ≈øonne of God receiues ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence from his father: Now working is according to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting, therefore the life of grace, ≈øpoken of <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 25. is wrought by the humane nature of Chri≈øt, as it is ≈øu≈øtained by his per≈øon, and his per≈øon being from the father, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ≈øame life from him: ≈øo then it is giuen to the ≈øonne in regard of his manner of ≈øub≈øi≈øting, to bee the di≈øpen≈øer and di≈øpo≈øer of the life of grace, whereof the father is the beginner, &amp;c. But as God <hi>he quickeneth whom he will,</hi> v. 21. and that as he hath life in him≈øelfe. Life, will, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding are Attributes of the e≈ø≈øence, and ≈øo ≈øimply one in them all. Here may the ≈øicke finde a Phy≈øitian, the broken a balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> the fearefull a ≈øhelter, the flyer a refuge, and the breath-le≈ø≈øe ≈øpirit a ble≈ø≈øed re≈øt. The ≈øonne of God hath wedded to him≈øelfe our humanitie, without all po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of devorce; the body hangs on the Cro≈ø≈øe, the ≈øoule is yeelded, the God-head is eviternally vnited to them both. And if Chri≈øt be God, and by his ≈øub≈øi≈øting &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, come ≈øo neare vs, what ≈øhould di≈ø≈øolue the eternall bonds of our heauenly coniunction with him, or the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influences of grace from him? Here are the apples and flagons of holy con≈øolation, and it is good for the Spou≈øe to be walking into the Gardens, and eating of the≈øe fruits. Wee cannot hope to be ≈øo neare to our God, as Chri≈øt was, vnited per≈øonally: yet need wee not feare that God ≈øhould ≈øeeme more ab≈øent from vs, then hee did from his owne ≈øonne. Hee was ≈øtill one with both body and ≈øoule, when they were devided from them≈øelues; when he was ab≈øent to ≈øen≈øe, he was pre≈øent to faith; when ab≈øent in vi≈øion, yet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3808:59"/>in vnion one and the ≈øame: ≈øo will hee bee to our ≈øoules, when they are at wor≈øt. He is ours, and we are his: if our hold ≈øeeme loo≈øened, his is not: when temptations will not let vs ≈øee him, he ≈øees vs, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth vs; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him again≈øt ≈øen≈øe, aboue hope; and though he kill vs, yet let vs tru≈øt in him. <hi>Shiloach</hi> refre≈øheth <hi>Ieru≈øalem, Iordan Naaman,</hi> better then <hi>Abanah,</hi> and <hi>Pharphar. Cherith</hi> dried vp while <hi>Eliah</hi> dranke of it. <hi>Iacobs</hi> well was ≈øtopped vp, but this well of liuing water no drought can dimini≈øh, nor <hi>Phili≈øtimes</hi> ≈øtop vp.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes yet in the fift place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the three per≈øons are coe≈ø≈øentiall, as hauing the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence together, and that not devided or by parts:</hi> but as (if I may ≈øo ≈øpeake with reverence) three partners in a Ship, haue not each a peece of it, but wholly, and together. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ≈øonne are often two di≈øtinct men, &amp; haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanitie devided by parts betweene them: but here the per≈øons di≈øtingui≈øhed by relation, are vndevided in e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence. And the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the father cannot beget one le≈ø≈øe then him≈øelfe, and therefore he being infinite his ≈øonne mu≈øt likewi≈øe be infinite. And that which is infinite admits of no divi≈øion, or di≈øtribution. Now the three per≈øons being co e≈ø≈øentiall, are likewi≈øe co-equall, and co-eternall. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. He that walketh in the Sunne for plea≈øure, may bee tainted with the heate thereof before he retire: ≈øo they that are drawne by delight into the≈øe cogitations, may thereby take the touch of a more deepe impre≈ø≈øion. Papi≈øts (as I haue read) hauing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge of our Ladies countenance &amp; fauour, haue a≈ø≈øembled the faire≈øt Curtezans to draw the mo≈øt mode≈øt beautie of a Virgin out of the flagrancie of Harlots: ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who≈øe skill is very ≈ølender in this my≈øtery, out of their owne devotion, haue broached many ≈øtrange conceits of the Trinitie, and left them as Oracles for their followers. But wee ≈øtudy to expre≈ø≈øe the≈øe things as neere as wee can with truth of matter, and ≈øobriety of ≈øpeech; for truth fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more ea≈øie entrance, when it commeth armed with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3808:59"/>his owne force, and adorned with the furniture of words that may be≈øt be≈øeeme it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ob≈øerue you in the la≈øt place from the definition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are one in another, and with another, mutually delighting and glorifying each other.</hi> Pro. 8.22.30. Ioh. 1.1.2. and 5.20. and 10.38. and 13.31.32. and 14.10. and 17.5. The Sonne is a delight to the Father in the worke of our Redemption, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.18. and the Spirit a ioy to them both, in the worke of our ≈øanctification.<note place="margin">Pro. 8.30.31</note> If the ≈øonne had not beene the fathers dayly delight, he had never reioyced in the habitable part of the earth, nor had his delights with the ≈øonnes of men. Behold, oh man, that ≈øtande≈øt in the wayes, inquiring for life, here it is, labour thou to delight in them, that are delighted in thee, and reioyce together to worke out thy ≈øaluation. Alas, how ≈øhould it pitty our hearts, to ≈øee many ≈øilly Soules runne vp and downe in the common labyrinth of error, groaping for the ≈øtrait and narrow gate of life, like the blind <hi>Sodomites</hi> after <hi>Lots</hi> doore, each man telling his dreame to his neighbour, of an imagined happine≈ø≈øe. And though they draw and drinke in iniquitie, yet will they ≈øtill dreame of drawing in the ea≈øie yoake of a Sauiour, when God wotes they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver driuen vnto it. Is this the pa≈øtime of the ble≈ø≈øed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to ≈øport them≈øelues together in doing vs good, and ≈øhall wee be intreated (like madde men) to be good vnto our ≈øelues? O how many that never ta≈øted of the≈øe delights, yet thinke them≈øelues in skie and highe≈øt ≈øphere of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe? Alas, how many walking Gho≈øts in the ≈øhapes of liuing men, applaud them≈øelues, like ≈øwine in earthly plea≈øures? O the watery plea≈øures of <hi>Epicurean</hi> hoggs, that ≈øatiate them≈øelues with the huskes of vanity, and cry out in their madne≈ø≈øe, that they haue liued the onely ioviall and iocand life. The≈øe (like <hi>Moles</hi> in the earth) are ever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting vp, as re≈øtle≈ø≈øe in them≈øelues. Surely, he goes lightly that wants the≈øe loads; as loath to lagge in the foule≈øt weather. The <hi>Bu≈øtard</hi> by rea≈øon of his great body, and bulke of bones, when he is pur≈øued, can hardly get vpon

Oh how ≈øhould our right conceit of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Trinitie, carry our ≈øoules vpon the wing, and make them a≈øcend? Alas, ambitious mindes of ayery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are but ambitious of their owne de≈øtruction, who climbing the ≈ølippery hill of high preferment, mea≈øure more then their length in their dangerous downe-falls; whereas he that ≈øtands on oven-ground is as ≈øoone vp as downe. O then that the Chri≈øtian ≈øoule would ≈øay to it ≈øelfe in a word or two, how liue≈øt thou? know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider from whom thou drawe≈øt thy breath, and remember that one day led with the ble≈ø≈øed Trinitie, is better then an immortalitie of the worlds windie vanities.</p>

               <p>Two things. <hi>Fir≈øt, that howbeit the Sub≈øi≈øtences are the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence, yet not as e≈ø≈øence: but as it is with the relatiue properties.</hi> A Scholler or a teacher is a man: but not a Scholler or a teacher as a man; for, as he in≈øtructeth he is a teacher, and as he learneth a Scholler. Which are relatiue properties. This my≈øtery cloudeth the cleare≈øt of our thoughts: yet from ≈øo many rayes, wee mu≈øt ≈øtudy to light ≈øome little torch, to quicken our owne feeble ≈øights.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>As betweene a man, and a Scholler,</hi> who though he be a man, yet not as a Scholler; for then ≈øhould euery man be a Scholler, becau≈øe he is a man. But indeed he is a Scholler, becau≈øe he learneth, and a man as he is compo≈øed of a body and rea≈øonable ≈øoule: ≈øo, that he is a man in one re≈øpect, and a Scholler in another. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Thou that teache≈øt another, teache≈øt thou not thy ≈øelfe.</hi> Where you ≈øee the ≈øame man is to be both ma≈øter and Scholler. I am a≈øtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed at ≈øo many wonders as I behold en≈øtated and packe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp in this rich Cabinet of the knowledge of GOD. <hi>They that goe downe into the deepes, they ≈øee the workes and wonders of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P≈øal. 107.23.</note> But they that goe downe into this deepe are not like to ≈øee any thing, except they plow with his heyfer, that can read vs the darke≈øt riddles. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.9.10.11. Chri≈øt in this my≈øtery, applies two rules of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the one, concerning their mutuall knowledge, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their mutuall being. <hi>He that hath ≈øeene me, hath ≈øeene my Father:</hi> that is, <hi>Philip,</hi> know one and know both; if thou beleeue mee to be the ≈øonne, then mu≈øt thou beleeue my father. For it is impo≈ø≈øible to conceiue a ≈øonne without a father. Againe, I am in the father, and the father is in me: that is, our being is mutuall, if I were not his ≈øonne, he were not my father, and if he were not my father, I were not his ≈øonne. As I haue the being of a ≈øonne from my father, ≈øo hath he the being of a father from his ≈øonne. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the nece≈ø≈øitie of relation, <hi>I am in my father, and my father is in mee. Abraham</hi> as a father is in <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>I≈øaac</hi> as a ≈øonne is in <hi>Abraham:</hi> but becau≈øe they are al≈øo two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct men, <hi>I≈øaac</hi> is al≈øo out of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>I≈øaac.</hi> But the eternall father and the ≈øonne hauing the ≈øame ≈øingular e≈ø≈øence, are per≈øonally the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and e≈ø≈øentially the one the other. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are they then di≈øtinct?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>As the man and the Scholler:</hi> And here to avoyd all doubts and dangers, and that a godly appetite may finde
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3808:61"/>what to feed on, let rea≈øon ruled by Scriptures ≈øupply with the defectiue, what he either reads not, or in reading knowes not. <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The word was with God, and the word was God.</hi> If God in both places be taken in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe; then the ≈øecond per≈øon is ≈øo a concrete with the e≈ø≈øence, as in rea≈øon the e≈ø≈øence may be predicated of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the difference is rationall, not reall: or if you will haue the argument, the e≈ø≈øence and ≈øub≈øi≈øtence are diver≈øe not oppo≈øite. They turne ≈øides not backes. The e≈ø≈øence di≈ø≈øents from the ≈øub≈øi≈øtence by rea≈øons apprehen≈øion, not natures oppo≈øition; for if they were oppo≈øite, he that is with God could not be ≈øayd to be God. So that the holy Gho≈øt reacheth vs by that phra≈øe, that the ≈øonne for manner of ≈øub≈øi≈øting is with the e≈ø≈øence, as if it were to bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued clo≈øe by the ≈øide of it, as the manner of a thing is to the being of it. And againe, lea≈øt wee ≈øhould there mi≈ø-take, by putting too great a difference, as if the manner ≈øhould differ really from the thing, he addes, <hi>and the ≈øame was God.</hi> So then the difference is very little, a diver≈øitie, no reall repugnancie. They turne a≈øide our apprehen≈øion without cro≈ø≈øing, or contrarietie. If God in the fir≈øt place be taken per≈øonally, and in the ≈øecond e≈ø≈øentially, then <hi>with God,</hi> is with the father, and ≈øo they are not diver≈øe but contraries, not (if I may ≈øo ≈øpeake with reuerence) as backe to backe, but face to face. I am thy father, thou art therefore my ≈øonne: but when I ≈øay, I am thy father, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am not thy ≈øonne, in this they are contrary, not in the other. And therefore wee ≈øay the properties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable. I am the begetter, therefore not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Yet if I be the begetter, thou art my begotten. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.7. So then the Sub≈øi≈øtences are contraries with mutuall affection: but e≈ø≈øence and ≈øub≈øi≈øtence are diver≈øe by Logicall apprehen≈øion. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my father are one.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. The≈øe three are one: as relatiues or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries they cannot be one; but as ≈øub≈øi≈øtences in the ≈øame e≈ø≈øence they are all one. I ≈øhould be thankefull to my ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he would not ≈øuffer idlene≈ø≈øe to deuour the ≈øweete
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3808:61"/>that others ≈øweat for, or would but ≈øo much as count the≈øe labours plea≈øant as they are prepared to his hand. But I feare, as the <hi>Ia≈ø≈øians</hi> in <hi>Strabo</hi> delighted with the mu≈øique of an exqui≈øite Harper, ran all away as ≈øoone as they heard the Fi≈øh-market bell ring, ≈øaue a deafe olde man, &amp;c. So they that ≈øeeme to be delighted with the knowledge of divine things, are ea≈øily called off by worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and if any ≈øtay by it, they profit no more by this Doctrine, then the deafe man did by the Harpers ditties. The Mini≈øters haue ≈øome-thing to doe that breake vp the ≈øwarth, and ≈øowe it for vs. I ≈øhall de≈øire no more but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attention, and patience, to weigh all points diligently, and with humilitie to yeeld vp their owne fancies to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. The hot and headdie are not to be imployed in the contemplation and ≈øearch of the≈øe truthes; for, as being ≈øuddaine in their actions, they ≈øeize lightly on that which commeth fir≈øt to hand: ≈øo being ≈øtiffe in their re≈øolution, they are tran≈øported with euery preiudicate conceit, from one errour to another. Giue me therefore a con≈øtant and ≈øtable ≈øtudent, and he ≈øhall gaine by this good.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doe the≈øe relatiue properties adde any thing to the e≈ø≈øence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Nothing but re≈øpect and manner of being: ≈øo that the e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence remaineth ≈øtill pure, or meere e≈ø≈øence.</hi> The relation of a father, ma≈øter, ≈øervant, &amp;c. are no addition of a new e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21. The learner and the teacher may bee the ≈øame man. He is a right Mauchen, or gazing ≈øtocke, that thinkes him≈øelfe a new man, becau≈øe he is a new ma≈øter. As <hi>Saul</hi> was changed to another man pre≈øently vpon his anointing, ≈øo are men vpon their advancement; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ordinary Proverbe, <hi>Their good and their bloud ri≈øes together:</hi> Now it may not bee taken as it hath beene. Other fa≈øhions, fare, and furniture fit them whom favour graceth. But alas, what is relation to Greatne≈ø≈øe, where there is no alteration in goodne≈ø≈øe, the man is the ≈øame, though he haue the re≈øpect of a King.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:3808:62"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øecond thing meant by relatiue properties?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the Sub≈øi≈øtences, or per≈øons, are di≈øtinct by them≈øelues as Relatiues.</hi> From the e≈ø≈øence (as we haue ≈øaid) they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as diver≈øe, onely turning a≈øide a little: but among≈øt them≈øelues they differ as contraries, hauing mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect; for, though the ≈øonne be the ≈øonne of the father, and the father the father of the ≈øonne: yet the father is not the ≈øonne, neither is the ≈øonne the father. So likewi≈øe the holy Gho≈øt, proceedeth from the father and the ≈øonne, yet is he neither the father, nor the ≈øonne. A father &amp; a ≈øonne being relatiues, are contraries: yet both of them may be no more then diver≈øe to the ≈øame man that is both. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Abrahambegate I≈øaac, and I≈øaac begate Iacob, &amp;c. I≈øaac</hi> is both father and ≈øonne. Sonne in regard of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and father in regard of <hi>Iacob. Plato</hi> told the Mu≈øitians of his time, that Phylo≈øophers could dine and ≈øup without them; how much more ca≈øie ought it to bee for Chri≈øtians to weane them≈øelues from childi≈øh rattles, and may games of carnall delights, and be merry without a Fidler? It is for <hi>Saul</hi> to driue away his ill ≈øpirit, and dumps of melancholy with <hi>Dauids</hi> Harpe: and for <hi>Caine,</hi> to ≈øtill his crying con≈øcience with building of Cities: ≈øo, for them that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not li≈øpe a word of a better life, to feede them≈øelues, not by ≈øooping an handfull with <hi>Gideons Souldiers,</hi> but by ≈øwilling their bellies full of worldly plea≈øures, and other ≈øuch ≈øwill and ≈øwades, as they are wont to weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues withall. The≈øe cry, the way of God is hard, and not for their medling; e≈øpecially, the≈øe maine my≈øteries, and therefore they abhorre once to thinke of the ≈øtudie of them. Indeed, as in the mo≈øt champion &amp; plaine grounds of Religion, there are ≈øome hillockes higher then the re≈øt of their fellowes: ≈øo, in the≈øe the greate≈øt and ≈øteepe≈øt hills thereof, there is footing enough, whereby with labour and travaile, with much reading, and often prayer, wee may come to the height of them, wherein wee may ≈øee and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ≈øo farre off the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the kingdome of heaven, as may be ≈øufficient for ever to make vs happy.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:3808:62"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the per≈øons cannot be one the other.</hi> The e≈ø≈øence and ≈øub≈øi≈øtence may be one the other, as the father is God, and the ≈øonne is God, and the holy Gho≈øt is God: but the father is not the ≈øonne; neither is the holy Gho≈øt, either father or ≈øonne. A ma≈øter and a man may bee the one the other: but a ma≈øter and a ≈øervant cannot be ≈øo predicated, the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe they are contraries, or really oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite: the other onely diver≈øe, and therefore may be di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed affirmatiuely. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed be God, the father of our Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> God and the father are one the other, the father is God, and God is the father: but as he is father of his ≈øonne, wee finde no ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øition in the Bible. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. They are ≈øayd to be one: that is, in e≈ø≈øence, will, or action, not in per≈øon; for ≈øo they are two, really di≈øtinct. I know the≈øe vocall ≈øounds are but a complement; and as an outward ca≈øe, wherein our thoughts are ≈øheathed. There is nothing wherein the want of words can wrong and grieue vs more, then in this point: here alone, as wee can adore, and not conceiue, ≈øo we can conceiue, and not vtter; yea, vtter our ≈øelues, and not be conceiued; yet, as wee may, thinke here of one ≈øub≈øtance in three ≈øub≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; one e≈ø≈øence in three relations; one <hi>Iehovab</hi> begetting, begotten, proceeding; Father, Sonne, Spirit: yet ≈øo as they differ but rationally from the e≈ø≈øence, and really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them≈øelues; and in regard thereof admit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the e≈ø≈øence of each per≈øon, and not of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons one of another.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What may el≈øe be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are together by nature,</hi> for ≈øo are all relatiues. They are mutuall cau≈øes and effects, a thing in rea≈øon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peculiar to this head of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t: as the father is the cau≈øe of his ≈øonnes relation, and ≈øo is the ≈øonne of his fathers. And on the contrary, they are effects of each others rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by vertue of this, they mu≈øt needs be together in nature. The cau≈øe is before his effect; and ≈øo the father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his ≈øonne, might ≈øeeme in nature to be before him:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3808:63"/>but this mutuall cau≈øation, though it pervert not order, yet makes it things to be together mo≈øt naturally. The father is onely before the fonne, and ≈øpirit, in order of ≈øub≈øi≈øting, and not in nature, either of e≈ø≈øence, or ≈øub≈øi≈øtence. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.22.30. <hi>Chri≈øt was ever with the father.</hi> Ioh. 1.1. <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, without beginning, was the word with God.</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>The very expre≈ø≈øe image of his per≈øon;</hi> and therefore a ≈øonne by nature: for if he were a creature, he ≈øhould be a fonne by coun≈øell, as the ≈øonnes of men are ≈øaid to be. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will begate he vs.</hi> Hee that begets by nature begets no le≈ø≈øe then him≈øelfe; as a man begets no le≈ø≈øe then a man; &amp; euery creature brings forth his ownekind. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.24.25. But coun≈øell and will beget ≈øuch images of them≈øelues, as be≈øt plea≈øe them: ≈øo man was by counfell made in the image of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. Ad here the error of the <hi>Arians</hi> can no more infect the truth of the Scriptures, in the point of Chri≈øts Diuinitie, then the truth of the Scriptures can iu≈øtifie them in their wretched allegation of them. A bad worke-man may v≈øe a good in≈øtrument: and often-times a cleane napkin wipeth a foule mouth. If there were no more Scripture again≈øt them, then that one text, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.18. nor no more words in the whole Bible, then that one <hi>(Monogenees)</hi> onely begotten, it were ≈øufficient to confute and confound all they haue ≈øayd, and to leaue their cau≈øe de≈øperate, and without all plea, though they were neuer ≈øo hear tie patrons of their owne affections. God the father hath many ≈øonnes, and an onely ≈øonne: now this difference is made by the manner of generation or begetting; and all the world can invent no other, but nature and coun≈øell; nay, why ≈øay I invent, when the Scripture hath found it out to their hands, and left it them to ob≈øerue. By coun≈øell the father may beget many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea, and twi≈øe beget them, as his elect, by creation and regeneration. But by nature hee cannot beget more then one ≈øonne, and becau≈øe he is begotten by nature, hee is no le≈ø≈øe then his father, and becau≈øe no le≈ø≈øe then his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore an onely ≈øonne. For if his whole image be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3808:63"/>in one, it cannot be in two. But I ≈øee if wee breake our teeth with the≈øe hard ≈øhells, wee ≈øhall finde ≈ømall plea≈øure in the kernells; neither doe I thinke that Gods ≈øchoole is more of vnder≈øtanding then affection: both le≈ø≈øons are very needfull, very profitable; but for this age wherein there is coldne≈ø≈øe of care, e≈øpecially the latter. He that hath much skill, and no affection, may doe good to others by information of judgement; but ≈øhall neuer haue thanke, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his owne heart, or of God, who v≈øeth not to ca≈øt away his loue on tho≈øe, of whom hee is but knowne, not loued. O Lord (≈øeeing therefore that men are but men by their vnder≈øtandings, and Chri≈øtians by their wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) make me to affect my relation to thee as a father, and thy ≈øonne as a brother; and becau≈øe coun≈øell in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, followes nature in being, let me find and feele how ≈øweet it is to be placed vnder thy ≈øonne, who from thee, as thou of thy ≈øelfe, makes mee both ≈øonne and brother, and fellow heire with him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence, that they are together by nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are onely in order one before another, according to their manner of ≈øub≈øi≈øting.</hi> As the father before the ≈øonne, and both of them before the holy Gho≈øt. Order requires, that the begetter ≈øub≈øi≈øt before the begotten, and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> before the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Ioh. 15.26. <hi>I will ≈øend from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Comferter, even the ≈øpirit of truth.</hi> As there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ≈øub≈øi≈øting, ≈øo in working. And here the well of life lies open before the godly, though their eyes often (like <hi>Agars</hi>) are not open to ≈øee it: whiles mi≈øerable world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings haue neither water, nor eyes. And becau≈øe to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians there can be no comfort in their ≈øecret felicities; ≈øeeing to be happy and not to know it, is little aboue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable; let me here fell them ≈øome of that ≈øpirituall eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalue, which the Spirit commends to the <hi>Laodiceans;</hi> that they may clearely ≈øee how well they are in the true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of this order. I know it to be v≈øuall with all men liuing, that they doe not much more want that which they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3808:64"/>haue not, then that which they doe not know they haue. A≈ø≈øuredly, there is nothing, but a few ≈øcales of ignorance and infidelitie betwixt vs and our happine≈ø≈øe. It lies in a narrow compa≈ø≈øe, but ≈øoundly tru≈ø≈øed together; for it is from the Father, in the Sonne, by the Spirit to Faith. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. Loue from the Father, as the beginner of our happine≈ø≈øe. Grace from the Sonne, as the di≈øpen≈øer of it. And a ble≈ø≈øed &amp; happy communion from the holy Gho≈øt, as the accompli≈øher, or fini≈øher of it. Loue, Grace, and Communion, are enough to pa≈ø≈øe the beleeuer from death to life. The father cannot manife≈øt his loue, without the grace of his ≈øonne, neither can the ≈øpirit therein commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with vs, but as he is ≈øent from both, after both to manife≈øt the loue of the one in beginning, and the grace of the other, in di≈øpen≈øing all things needfull for our ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thinke not much, that this gla≈ø≈øe of the word e≈øpies that in vs, and for vs, what our ≈øelues ≈øee not: too much neerene≈ø≈øe oft-times hindereth ≈øight: and if for the ≈øpots of our owne faces wee tru≈øt others eyes and gla≈ø≈øes, why not this truth for our perfections? wee are in heauen, and know it not. What greater happines then this, to be made partakers of the pure≈øt Loue, riche≈øt Grace, and choice≈øt Communion? <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.15. Our election is begunne by the will, coun≈øell, and decree of the Father; di≈øpen≈øed by the complete, and full redemption of the Sonne; fini≈øhed by the powerfull and effectuall application of the Spirit. It is not without due con≈øideration, why in the beginning of the Apo≈øtolicall Epi≈øtles, <hi>Grace and peace</hi> are wi≈øhed <hi>from the Father and the Sonne,</hi> without mention of the Spirit. I may, and will, reine the que≈øtion ≈øhorter, then they doe, that confound the per≈øons in their workes. The Spirit is ≈øent from the Father and the Sonne, to witne≈ø≈øe that grace and peace that wee haue from, and with them both. He that is from them both by in≈øpiration, is to them both with vs as lidger in execution. When good things are wi≈øhed from ≈øome per≈øons, it is requi≈øite that there be ≈øome to carry newes of their will and plea≈øure therein. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3808:64"/>Church of God hath the glorious Go≈øpell of life and ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and therein is contained all grace and peace with God: but how ≈øhall euery ≈øoule be certified, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈ø≈øed in tho≈øe good things, except the Father and the Sonne, ≈øend the Spirit, as a witne≈ø≈øe and ≈øeale thereof vnto him in particular? Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epi≈øtles, wi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace and peace from Father and Sonne, not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit, ob≈øerues the true order of per≈øonall ≈øub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting, and per≈øonall working. And therefore peace pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed by grace, whereby the Father is reconciled in his Sonne, is wi≈øhed to the Churches; the fruition whereof followeth by the worke of the ble≈ø≈øed Spirit in all that are ordained to be partakers thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What kind of properties are the≈øe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Individuall</hi> and <hi>incommunicable,</hi> and being giuen to the Father, Sonne, and holy Gho≈øt, make three di≈øtinct <hi>per≈øons,</hi> and therefore the Church of God hath done well ≈øo to name them, though the word be not in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it is a Latine word, and therefore cannot be found in the Originalls, which are <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Thus far haue we freely dipped in this ≈øtreame, and not bin drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; pulled many fragrant ro≈øes, and not pricked our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; there is one thing more that may ≈øting vs, if godly di≈øcretion ≈øerue not to ≈øever the good from the ill; yet the former le≈ø≈øons well remembred are ≈øufficient, to them that are capable of ob≈øervation, and not carele≈ø≈øe of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, to keepe them from danger: but ≈øeeing remarkable con≈øideration put into vs by others, are as ≈øome loofe pearles, which for want of filing vpon a ≈øtring, ≈øhake out of our pockets; it ≈øhall be nece≈ø≈øary both for the getting and keeping of the trea≈øure of our vnder≈øtanding, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are then the≈øe properties, qualities in the divine e≈ø≈øence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are relatiue affections, no inherent qualities;</hi> for, they doe no wayes change, or alter the e≈ø≈øence, but leaue it ≈øtill ≈øimply one. I know naturall rea≈øon would here ≈øend forth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3808:65"/>di≈øtemper into our whole judgement. The ≈øtreame mu≈øt needs runne like the fountaine, and ≈øpeeds well, if at la≈øt, by many changes of ≈øoile, it can leaue an ill qualitie behind it: ≈øo, our judgement ≈øhall be well purged, if by all the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages we can ≈øo farre ma≈øter rea≈øon, that the fardle of fooli≈øh fancies may here be vnloden, and God may purely be apprehended, as he is in him≈øelfe. But what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this age, fitter to looke after Butter-flies, or Birds ne≈øts, or perhaps ≈øome gay coat of a Courtier, then this ≈øound and ≈øolide knowledge of <hi>Iehovah-Elohim?</hi> Or if any trauell this way, it is indeed like our yong travellers, who≈øe wealth is found to be in their tongues, wherein they exceed and excell their parents parrats at home, both for that they can ≈øpeake more, and know that they ≈øpeake: ≈øo our <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Chri≈øtians, white onely in the teeth, euery where el≈øe cole blacke, can ≈øpeake well of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and that is all. But God is not ≈øo learned; for, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three parts of the body, there is one, called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous,</hi> or <hi>impul≈øiue,</hi> as the ≈øpirits, which ≈øets all on worke; or as Phy≈øitians call the <hi>Arteries</hi> in the body, <hi>Venas audaces,</hi> or <hi>micantes,</hi> from their continuall beating and working; which running along with the other veines beate &amp; knock at euery gate and entrance, for the members to take in provi≈øion: ≈øaying (as it were) to euery part and portion, here is meate and nouri≈øhment for you: ≈øo, true religion, hauing put into vs the royall and cele≈øtiall Spirit of Faith, calls vpon all powers and parts, not to know and ≈øpeake good things, but to liue and practi≈øe them. Papi≈øts teach, that a man may, and mu≈øt both make and eate his God to his break-fa≈øt: this hard meate wee leaue for their ≈øtronger mawes: yet even here may wee begin with the ≈øpoone, and offer nothing to our weaker ≈øtomackes, but di≈øcour≈øe of ea≈øie dige≈øtion. Know God, and liue by faith, and wee ≈øhall haue him for our ever-la≈øting food.</p>

               <p>An≈øwere.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>Father, Sonne, and holy Gho≈øt:</hi> or becau≈øe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues are but two, into the relation of Father and Sonne, to the ≈øpirit, which is breathing, or ≈øending, or of the Father to the Sonne, which is begetting. <hi>(Spirantes ≈øpiritus, Gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens genitus)</hi> how ea≈øie were it to loo≈øe our ≈øelues in this Di≈øcour≈øe? How hard not to be over-whelmed with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonder; and to finde, either beginning or end? Loe, with the≈øe words of relation, we are happily waded out of tho≈øe deepes, whereof our conceits can finde no bottomes, and now may wee more ≈øafely, with <hi>Peter,</hi> gird our coat about vs, and ca≈øt our ≈øelues a little into this ≈øea: onely, we mu≈øt remember, that as tho≈øe which had wont to ≈øwim onely with bladders, ≈øinke when they come fir≈øt to tru≈øt to their owne armes: ≈øo, wee may ≈øoone plunge our ≈øelues, if we ≈øuffer our owne thoughts to carry vs along in this my≈øtery. If any wonder, whether this di≈øcour≈øe can tend, let him con≈øider that of <hi>Tertullian, Ratio divina in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla e≈øt, non in ≈øuperficie,</hi> Divinitie is more in the marrow and roote, then the rind and ≈øurface of things. It cannot be doubted, but as God is the be≈øt being, ≈øo he is the be≈øt life, and that the be≈øt life is rea≈øonable; God therefore is the be≈øt vnder≈øtanding. Suffer your ≈øelues with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Ramme, to be perplexed a while in the≈øe bryers, that you may be prepared to pre≈øent your ≈øelues for liuing ≈øacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, holy, and acceptable to this dreadfull Trinitie. <hi>Singula verba plena ≈øunt ≈øen≈øibus</hi> (as <hi>Hierome</hi> ≈øayd of the Booke of <hi>Iob.</hi>) As being by nature, ≈øo vnder≈øtanding by coun≈øell, is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3808:66"/>able to conceiue and beget the image of it ≈øelfe, and from the one to the other to ≈øend a mutuall loue &amp; liking: onely in the creatures both the≈øe are imperfect; for, nature doth generate to pre≈øerue it ≈øelfe, and vnder≈øtanding conceiues to perfect it ≈øelfe. No vnder≈øtanding by nature conceiues it ≈øelfe, and no being by coun≈øell begets it ≈øelfe. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perfection of vnder≈øtanding naturally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it ≈øelfe: God doth both ≈øpeake, and worke in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as a Father ≈øayth well: but here needs nothing be fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fa≈øten this truth vpon vs. It ≈øhall bee evinced by plaine demon≈øtration. The be≈øt being, and be≈øt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, mu≈øt needs conceiue the be≈øt image of it ≈øelfe; now in conceiuing it begets it, and being begotten by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is no le≈ø≈øe then the begetter. Man by nature begets no le≈ø≈øe then him≈øelfe: by coun≈øell hee can conceiue that which is le≈ø≈øe or greater then him≈øelfe: ≈øo the father by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can beget no le≈ø≈øe then him≈øelfe, though by coun≈øell he conceiued and brought forth a whole world, nothing comparable to him≈øelfe in greatne≈ø≈øe, or goodne≈ø≈øe. Well, then in one ≈øimple e≈ø≈øence there is nece≈ø≈øarily a begetter and a begotten, and ≈øo we haue the ≈øub≈øi≈øtences of Father and Sonne. He is out of the danger of folly, whom a ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die adverti≈øement leaveth wi≈øe. It is but an holy preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be devout vnbidden, and to ≈øerue God vpon our owne conceits. Let vs then ≈øee how the ≈øecond my≈øtery will follow. The father in begetting his owne image, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but loue it naturally, and the ≈øonne in being begotten cannot but as naturally loue the begetter. And hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds mutuall loue, and becau≈øe it is naturall, is no le≈ø≈øe in being then the begetter and begotten from whom it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; for the begetter and begotten loue them≈øelues na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and therefore the Spirit is God, and a third ≈øub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtence in the divine nature. If the per≈øons were eyther greater or le≈ø≈øe one then another, then would this ab≈øurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in≈øue vpon it, that neither the father could directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him≈øelfe, or father &amp; ≈øonne equally loue them≈øelues, &amp; con≈øequently never inioy their owne happine≈ø≈øe, which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3808:66"/>con≈øi≈øts in the full fruition of them≈øelues. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Chri≈øt is ≈øaid to be the expre≈ø≈øe image of the fathers ≈øub≈øi≈øtence. Some tran≈ølate it, ≈øub≈øtance, or e≈ø≈øence, which will all come to one pa≈ø≈øe, if ≈øub≈øtance be taken ≈øubiectiuely, not cau≈øely; for the divine e≈ø≈øence hath eminently all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of creatures; and therefore vnder≈øtanding, which is able to conceiue, and in conceiuing to beget, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting is a relatiue propertie, and hence the Sub≈øi≈øtence of the Father, whereof the Sonne is the expre≈ø≈øe image. It were as we haue formerly ≈øaid, improper locution, to call him the image of the e≈ø≈øence, for that begets not, yet in that is the begetter, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Where loue is giuen to the Spirit; not onely as hee worketh it in vs, but as he is the mutuall loue both of Father and Sonne, and ≈øo is ≈øent from both of them, to te≈øtifie of their loue to vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. O that the≈øe things in their true worth could affect vs, but alas, as in a Taverne where many Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are ≈øeene repleni≈øhed with gue≈øts, halfe ≈øoaked, and ≈øow≈øed in wine; all the hou≈øe re≈øoundeth with laughters, cries, whoopings, and ≈øtrange noi≈øe, wherein the ≈øweete≈øt mu≈øicke in the world, is both neglected and mocked: ≈øo, our age, inchanted with rude and ridiculous pa≈øtimes, gibeth at this holy and heauenly contemplation of the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ble≈ø≈øed Trinitie. How many doth God ≈øuffer to liue and breath, which make the Taverne their Temple, <hi>Indian</hi>-≈ømoake their incen≈øe, Sacke their ≈øacrifice, and bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous oathes their daily prayers: for the loue of this dreadfull Trinitie, and the deare loue of your owne ≈øoules, remember <hi>S.

Hitherto we haue had many Reaches to fetch in our way, and beene con≈øtrained to winde in by bourds, but wee are gotten off the Maine; onely the ≈øhore is ≈øtill buttre≈øt with rockes on euery hand, the Currents ≈øwift, the Shallowes many, that wee cannot make ≈øo fre≈øh a way as wee would. Haue but

The ≈øhip that hath beene long at Sea, di≈øcouered many ≈øtrange Continents, and ryvers, ≈øtrugled through many hiddeous tempe≈øts, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped many rockes and quick-≈øands, and at length made a rich returne, cannot but forget her irke≈øome Travell, and thinke ≈øhee is well apaid, when ≈øhee commeth within the kenne of her owne Countrey, and ≈øees the Land lye faire before her: So, hee that coa≈øts along the≈øe ≈øeverall bankes and bounds of godline≈ø≈øe, and in the Ship of the Church, is brought into the mouth of the haven of heaven, cannot but with ioy remember all the troubles and afflictions he hath indured in this world. In a word, vnder≈øtand this but as a letter of adverti≈øement from the Coa≈øt, whereby thou maye≈øt with the greater ea≈øe, reape the profit of them that haue travelled before thee.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the relatiue propertie of the Father, and the Sonne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>To breath, or ≈øend forth the ≈øpirit.</hi> Ioh. 15.26. <hi>I will ≈øend from the father the Comforter, even the ≈øpirit of truth.</hi> The ≈øame is ≈øaid to proceed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God hath ≈øent forth the ≈øpirit of his ≈øonne into your hearts.</hi> Ioh. 16.8. As the ≈øonne comes from the father to take our nature vpon him, ≈øo the ≈øpirit comes from them both, to apply Chri≈øt effectually vnto vs, and vs vnto Chri≈øt. But this comming, ≈øending, proceeding is a worke of coun≈øell, not of nature; for the Spirit by an imminent act as he comes from father &amp; ≈øon, ≈øo he hath his re≈øidence in them both, and no creature is capable of him: but as by a tran≈øient act hee pa≈ø≈øeth the worke of Redemption to vs by application, hee is ≈øayd to come to vs, and we receiue him in graces and operations. By nature he comes from the ≈øame per≈øons, and re≈øts in them: by coun≈øell (not by command) he comes to vs, and is ≈øaid to dwell with vs, and that in ≈øpite of Satan &amp; all his temptations. As fierce Ma≈øtiues tyed in a chaine, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they both barke, and haue perhaps a good will to bite, yet they can make no neerer approach then the chaine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3808:67"/>doth permit: ≈øo, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> of hell is chained vp of God, and though his malice be great to labour to enter, where he is expul≈øed, yet the ≈øpirit keepes him out by his pre≈øence, and ≈øafegards our hearts in peace, again≈øt all his mole≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The fir≈øt per≈øon, who by nature begets his ≈øonne,</hi> who mu≈øt needs be an onely ≈øonne, becau≈øe the Father cannot haue many images of him≈øelfe. Chri≈øt is the <hi>fir≈øt begotten,</hi> Heb. 1.6. and <hi>the onely begotten.</hi> Ioh. 3.16.18. 1 Ioh. 4.9. Ioh. 1.14.18. And therefore the relation betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Chri≈øt, is a ≈øpeciall and peculiar re≈øpect. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will be to him a father and he ≈øhall be to me a ≈øonne.</hi> Man was made in the image and likene≈ø≈øe of God, and of the three per≈øons, by a divine con≈øultation; but Chri≈øt is the image of his Father, or fir≈øt per≈øon, by an eternall and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting generation. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. <hi>Adam</hi> is called the ≈øonne of God, which is a mo≈øt free and voluntary act of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in producing man in his owne image. This I in≈øi≈øt vpon the more, that wee may be wary in our conceits, in apprehending Gods act vpon vs, and the fathers act vpon his ≈øonne. It is happine≈ø≈øe enough for vs to come ≈øo neare God, that his onely ≈øonne may ≈øtand betwixt vs &amp; him, and that wee may be called his brethren, by the Fathers choice of vs in him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Fathers relatiue propertie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>To beget, and not to be begotten,</hi> and therefore he is the fir≈øt per≈øon in order. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Thou art my ≈øonne, this day haue I begotten thee. Heb.</hi> 1.5. The ≈øame words are repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to proue Chri≈øt aboue the Angels, who (<hi>Iob.</hi> 2.1.) are called <hi>the ≈øonnes of God,</hi> and therefore in another ≈øen≈øe, that is, in regard of Creation, and grace, both which they obtained by the will and coun≈øell of their Creator, who made them, and ordained them to ≈øtand in that favour, from which the reprobate Angels fell: but Chri≈øt is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and an eternall ≈øonne. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.25. And therefore to day, is (as ≈øome Fathers expound it) put for eternitie, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3808:68"/>all times are pre≈øent to God, to whom a thou≈øand yeares are as one pre≈øent day. Or rather this day (being the day of Chri≈øts re≈øurrection, and exaltation, <hi>in which he was mightily declared to be the ≈øonne of God.</hi> Rom. 1.4.) is the manife≈øtation of that eternall generation, by which hee is preferred before all creatures. His conception and natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as he was man belong to his humiliation, which (as S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øpeakes of his pa≈ø≈øion) was the ≈øleepe of his divinitie, as his death was the ≈øleepe of his humanitie. Yet as the fathers of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ≈øay truly, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>

The ≈øoule in the agony, and vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe, feeles not the pre≈øence of the God-head; the body in the graue feeles not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the ≈øoule: yet vpon the third day both bodie and ≈øoule did feele the power of his divine nature, death being too weake to di≈ø≈øolue the eternall bonds of this heauenly coniunction. And therefore vpon the day of Chri≈øts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection was there a manife≈øt declaration of the eternall generation of the ≈øecond per≈øon.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Sonne?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>A. <hi>I beleeue in God, who is one e≈ø≈øence, mo≈øt ≈øimple, pure, and ab≈øolute, and being e≈ø≈øentially indivi≈øible, is per≈øonally di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed into the Father, Sonne, and holy Gho≈øt, and is therefore called, Vnitie in Trinitie, and Trinitie in Vnitie,</hi> or <hi>Vnitrinitie, and Trinunitie.</hi> How to conceiue of this in our prayers, and meditations, is both the deepe≈øt point of all Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary: ≈øo deepe, that if wee wade into it, wee may ea≈øily drowne, never finde the bottome:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3808:69"/>≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, that without it, our ≈øelues, our ≈øeruices are prophane, irreligious: wee are all borne Idolaters, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prone to fa≈øhion God to ≈øome forme of our owne. Away then with all wicked thoughts, and gro≈ø≈øe devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and with <hi>Iacob</hi> bury all ≈øtrange gods vnder the oake of <hi>Shechem,</hi> ere we offer to ≈øet vp Gods Altar at <hi>Bethel:</hi> &amp; without all mentall re≈øervations, conceiue of our God purely, ≈øimply, ≈øpiritually; as of an ab≈øolute being, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme, without matter, without compo≈øition; yea, an infinite, without all limits of thoughts. Thinke of him as not to be thought of; as one who≈øe wi≈øedome is his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, who≈øe iu≈øtice is his power, who≈øe power is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and all him≈øelfe. Good without qualitie, great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quantitie, everla≈øting without time, pre≈øent euery where without place, containing all things without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. If this ≈øhall giue our devotions any light, it is well: the lea≈øt glimp≈øe of this knowledge, is worth all the full gleames of humane and earthly skill. After this weake direction, let vs ≈øtill ≈øtudy to conceiue aright, that we may pray aright; and ≈øtill pray, that we may conceiue: and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate more and more, that we may doe both. And the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øonne, and holy Gho≈øt, direct vs, inable vs, that wee may doe all. Amen.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Something concerning the e≈ø≈øence, and ≈øomething the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence.</hi> Gen. Chap. 1. to the end: the word <hi>Elohim</hi> is v≈øed aboue 30. times, and no other word for God. Chap. 2. is v≈øed <hi>Elohim</hi> alone to ver≈øe 4. and from thence to the end <hi>Iehovah Elohim</hi> con≈øtantly: a cour≈øe, I take it, not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled, or exemplified in any other portion of Scripture; and the rea≈øon is good: for, as long as the workes were in creating, the per≈øons ob≈øerued each their di≈øtinct manner of working, and ≈øo the holy Gho≈øt v≈øeth a phra≈øe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe it: as likewi≈øe after the worke was done, and a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ≈øanctified for re≈øt, all the three per≈øons reioyced in the workes of their hands. From the 4. ver≈øe of Chap. 2. to the end, the whole worke being done, and repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for the better ob≈øervation of it, and mo≈øt e≈øpecially of the true cau≈øe; <hi>Iehovah-Elohim</hi> are ever coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we might take notice, that creation did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt one God, three per≈øons, one God mo≈øt plainely, three per≈øons more ob≈øcurely, yet not ≈øo darkely, but if <hi>Adam</hi> had ≈øtood, he might haue gathered the ≈øame by GODS workeman≈øhip, both in him≈øelfe, and the creatures: and that wee that are fallen, being not able to read any ≈øuch matter, in the great Booke of the world, might ob≈øerue it by the little Booke of his word, which drawes the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe into two Chapters, as into a ≈ømall map giuing much good coun≈øell in a narrow roome, &amp; teaching that briefely which Phylo≈øophers haue ≈øcarce touched in great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then concerning the e≈ø≈øence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Has omnipotencie,</hi> which in nature is before all effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, yet becau≈øe we ≈øee fir≈øt by re≈øolution of Gods works, which is to goe from the effects to the cau≈øe, we ≈øee Gods omnipotencie by his efficiencie. And therefore in the Creed, wee beleeue in the Almightie, as the maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods omnipotencie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he is able to effect all that he doth, yea, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer he doth not, which is ab≈øolutely po≈ø≈øible.</hi> Mat. 19.26. <hi>With God all things are po≈ø≈øible.</hi> Math. 3.9. <hi>Of very ≈øtones to rai≈øe vp children to Abraham.</hi> Phil. 3.21. <hi>He is able to ≈øubdue all things vnto him≈øelfe.</hi> P≈øal. 135.6. <hi>What≈øoeuer the Lord plea≈øed, that did hee, both in heauen and in earth: in the Seas, and all deepe places.</hi> Mal. 2.15. <hi>Did not he make one? and yet had he the re≈øidue of the ≈øpirit,</hi> to wit, to haue created <hi>Adam</hi> more wiues. And here may well appeare the names, <hi>El,</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</hi> Deut. 9.10.17. P≈øal. 9.2. Dan. 4.17. Chri≈øt in the old Te≈øtament, and al≈øo in the new, is called, The Almightie, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. And ≈øo the Spirit is called the power of the Highe≈øt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why ≈øay you ab≈øolutely po≈ø≈øible, is there any thing impo≈ø≈øible to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes. <hi>All ≈øuch things as contradict either his owne e≈ø≈øence, or the nature of things.</hi> As God cannot lie, becau≈øe he is truth it ≈øelfe, neither can hee make a body to be in two places at once, as the body of Chri≈øt, to be in heauen, and vpon a Popi≈øh Altar at once. For that implies a contradiction, and therefore a lie, whereof the Papi≈øts, and not God, are Authors. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, and euery man a liar. Act.</hi> 3.21. Heauen is ≈øaid to receiue the body of Chri≈øt; now if it be wholly circum≈øcribed for length, breadth, and thickne≈ø≈øe, in the third heauen, it cannot at the ≈øame time be circum≈øcribed within the limits of the earth: for that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3808:70"/>which is finite in one place, cannot be infinite in two. It is onely Gods propertie to be in two places at once, neither included nor excluded: and therefore if the body of Chri≈øt were in heauen and earth at the ≈øame in≈øtant of time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther included nor excluded, it were no more a bodie, but a God: if they ≈øay the omnipotency of God may extend the dimen≈øions of Chri≈øts body, that it may at the ≈øame time fill heauen and earth: then is it not in two places at once, but in one by continuation, &amp; if the dimen≈øions of Chri≈øts body an≈øwere the dimen≈øions of the place, it ≈øhall be the greate≈øt mon≈øter that ever the world dreamed of; no, not <hi>Mahomet</hi> him≈øelfe did dreame hee ≈øaw God in a vi≈øion ≈øo bigge as the Papi≈øts haue made Chri≈øt. Let them neuer flee to Gods omnipotencie, to maintaine their I doll vpon the Altar, for it contradicts the very nature of a created bodie to be in two, or many places at once, or extended further then the nature of the creature will beare; if Chri≈øt had in his body all the 4 elements wholly, it could not be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fill the third heauen, and the earth at once; for, they are all formally extended to their perfection by God, and can fill no greater a place then is vnder the highe≈øt heauen; Chri≈øt therefore hauing but a little part of all the≈øe in his body, it were beyond a miracle, to extend that little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the whole. Againe, Chri≈øt hauing a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it mu≈øt not loo≈øe proportion: now the exten≈øion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one member more then is fit, makes a deformitie. There≈øore the bodie of Chri≈øt loo≈øing none of the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature, and receiuing greater perfections of glory, mu≈øt be contained in the third heaven, in ≈øuch a length, breadth, and thickne≈ø≈øe, as is fit for a body. So that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øtands with the power, or the wi≈øedome of God, to worke ≈øuch a miracle, as the Papi≈øts obtrude vpon the world.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how can we attribute power to God, who is pure act?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It cannot be giuen to God in re≈øpect of him≈øelfe, but onely of the creatures, which may feele his worke, which they never felt before.</hi> The fire alwayes burneth in it ≈øelfe, yet in regard
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3808:71"/>of this or that combu≈øtible matter, it is in power to burne, that is, the matter is in power to feele the act of the fire. So God ever acteth or worketh in him≈øelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.17. But the creature doth not ever feele it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 139.16. <hi>All things are ≈øaid to be done of God, long before the creature feeles his worke.</hi> Hence creation, as an action, is eternall, as a pa≈ø≈øion, in time. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth.</hi> In regard of heauen and earth, creation hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in regard of God it hath none. Time is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of creatures, not of the Creator.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What further appeareth from his omnipotencie and efficiencie together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His decree, which is a definitiue ≈øentence, concerning the effecting of all things by his mightie power, according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell of his will.</hi> What≈øoeuer God doth in his efficiency, and can doe by his omnipotencie, that he decreeth. I doe not ≈øimply ≈øay what he can doe he decreeth; for, the decree is onely of things to be done, his omnipotencie of things to be done, or not to be done: but thus I rea≈øon, What he doth, that he can doe; and what he can doe and doth, that he decreeth to be done. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.11. <hi>According to the purpo≈øe of him, that worketh all things after the coun≈øell of his will.</hi> Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie and omnipotencie manife≈øt the decree, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them both, and a cau≈øe of them. So that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either in creation, or providence, whereof the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is not ≈øome wayes a cau≈øe; yet mu≈øt we not ≈øo much ≈øtand poring vpon the decree of God, as runne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently to that place in Gods providence which will cleare &amp; manife≈øt vnto vs, that Gods decree is without all fault. The decree of <hi>Adams</hi> fall went before that part of Gods providence, which did gouerne his fall, and as providence workes it, ≈øo God decreed to haue it wrought.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What attributes appeare by the manife≈øtation of his decree?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Con≈øtancie, truth,</hi> and <hi>fidelitie,</hi> for the decree mu≈øt bee mo≈øt con≈øtant, true, and faithfull. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 14.24. <hi>As I haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, it ≈øhall come to pa≈ø≈øe, and what I haue con≈øulted ≈øhall ≈øtand.</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:3808:71"/>Ver≈ø. 27. <hi>The Lord hath determined, who ≈øhall di≈øanull it? his hand is ≈øtretched out, and who ≈øhall turne it away.</hi> Rom. 9.19.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his con≈øtancie in decreeing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby his decree remaineth con≈øtant and vnchangeable.</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord which change not, and yee ≈øonnes of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob are not con≈øumed.</hi> I≈øa. 46.10. <hi>My coun≈øell ≈øhall ≈øtand, and I will doe all my plea≈øure.</hi> Rom. 11.29. Heb. 6.17.18.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he deliuereth nothing but that which he decreeth. Truth</hi> is properly <hi>to pronounce as the thing is,</hi> but the thing is ever as God pronounceth it to be. You ≈øtand before me therefore I ≈øee you, is a good con≈øequence with man, but the cleane contrary is true with God; God ≈øeeth you, therefore you ≈øtand there. For truth is in God, before it be in the things, and in the things before it can be in me. The truth therefore of Gods definitiue ≈øentence is before the exi≈øtence of any creature, or action. It is not true, that the pre≈øcience of God, follows the thing done, or to be done, for then the truth of a thing ≈øhould be before God decreed it to be. As for example, God decreed this truth, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ≈øhould fall, this thing followes the foreknowledge of God in decreeing it to be: ≈øo that it followes more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus, God fore≈øaw that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, therefore hee fell, then on the contrary, <hi>Adam</hi> fell, therefore God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaw it. If truth ≈øhould not more immediately followe the will and coun≈øell of God, then the nature of things, then ≈øhould decreed truths be mutable, and ≈øome-times fal≈øe: but comming immediately from God, they are ever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as he decreeth them. <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he effecteth mo≈øt faithfully what≈øoeuer hee hath decreed.</hi> 1. Ioh. 1.9. <hi>He is faithfull and iu≈øt to forgiue vs our ≈øinnes:</hi> Confe≈ø≈øion is no cau≈øe of the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes, as being after it in nature. Yet God hath ≈øo decreed to linke

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His coun≈øell,</hi> for no decree is made without coun≈øell, and when Divines ≈øay, that Gods decree is his eternall coun≈øell, they ≈øpeake improperly, for it is a thing wrought by coun≈øell, and as the effect ≈øhewes the cau≈øe, ≈øo doth the decree of God his coun≈øell.

Chri≈øt died by the determinate coun≈øell &amp; foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; but that is the ≈øame with the decree; for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell more properly determines then is determined, and therefore the new Tran≈ølation ≈øpeakes more aptly, to doe what≈øoeuer thy hand and thy coun≈øell determined before to be done, and that this was the be≈øt for the effecting of our ≈øaluation, appeares. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.9.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods wi≈øedome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Idaea, or platforme of working all things mo≈øt wi≈øely;</hi> A wi≈øe man doth fir≈øt lay the plot in his head, and then frame the worke out of him≈øelfe; ≈øo, Almightie God hath fir≈øt in him≈øelfe the <hi>Idaea,</hi> or platforme of all things, and then accordingly frames his workes out of him≈øelfe, and the whole plot is ≈øo laid, that his end &amp; ≈øcope in all things may be obtained by it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>How manifold are thy workes? in wi≈øedome ha≈øt thou made them all.</hi> When the things are many, they are often a di≈øtraction vnto man, but GOD in regard of the excellency of his wi≈øedome knowes how to plot them all for the pray≈øe and glory of his owne maie≈øtie.</p>

For this we are to hold as a truth, that God fir≈øt ≈øees him≈øelfe, and then out of him≈øelfe all other things, either as they are the images and impre≈ø≈øions of him≈øelfe, or as they di≈ø≈øent and di≈øagree from it. Now this la≈øt knowledge is by way of oppo≈øition as one contrary giues light vnto another, evill is knowne by that which is good and fal≈øhood by that which is true: ≈øo that God hath no direct knowledge, either of evill or fal≈øhood, but that which is indirect, as they di≈ø≈øent from his truth and goodne≈ø≈øe. So that there is no plot of evill fir≈øt in God then in the creature, but it is a thing onely plotted by creatures ≈øubiect to ≈øinne, and ≈øo is knowne of God as oppo≈øite to his owne goodne≈ø≈øe.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3808:73"/>that God doth not decree ≈øinne to be as ≈øinne, but as in his wi≈øedome he ≈øeeth it to haue ≈øome re≈øpect of good, which is accidentall, and be≈øide the nature of it.

This is cleane contrary to S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Eph. 1.3. to 15. Where election, being an originall worke, is giuen to the Father, who di≈øpen≈øeth the ≈øame by his ≈øonne, and applies it by his ≈øpirit. So that the Father doth elect vs, before the Sonne redeeme vs, or the Spirit ≈øanctifie vs. Read the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and you ≈øhall finde creation and election more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attributed to the fir≈øt per≈øon, then either the ≈øecond or the third. And our Creed teacheth vs to call the Father Creator, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Sonnes manner of working?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>He worketh from the Father, by the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> Ioh. 5.19. <hi>The ≈øonne can doe nothing of him≈øelfe, ≈øaue that which hee
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3808:77"/>≈øeeth the Father doe, &amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 16.15. <hi>The Spirit ≈øhall take of mine, and ≈øhew it vnto you.</hi> And the rea≈øon is, the Sonne is from the Father, but the holy Gho≈øt is from them both.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the di≈øpen≈øaetion of all things is giuen to the Sonne:</hi> as there is an entrance into euery worke, ≈øo mu≈øt there bee a proceeding in it; and the Father in all things proceeds by his Sonne, as in the revelation &amp; declaration of his will. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. and the execution of all things in him≈øelfe, which may prepare for the worke of the ≈øpirit in vs. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.17. For till the Father haue done, the Sonne can doe nothing, neither is it for the Spirit to worke, vntill he take it from them both.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the holy Gho≈øts manner of working?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>To worke both from the Father and the Sonne.</hi> Ioh. 16.13. <hi>The Spirit ≈øhall not ≈øpeake, or doe any thing of him≈øelfe, but what≈øoeuer he ≈øhall heare from the Father and the Sonne,</hi> as the two next ver≈øes make it plaine. And the rea≈øon is that he ≈øub≈øi≈øting from them both, mu≈øt needs worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the con≈øummation of all things is giuen to the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> who ends the worke of the Father and the Sonne. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Let there be,</hi> is rather a word of con≈øummation, then commandement. The whole worke is carried by word and deed. <hi>God ≈øaid,</hi> the Father had none to ≈øpeake vnto but his Sonne: let there be, is that the word ≈øpoken might be done by the Spirit, who fini≈øheth what is ≈øpoken by both. And here we ≈øee by what kind of motion the world was made, by the lea≈øt ≈øtirring, for what is le≈ø≈øe then to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all by a word. And yet what greater, then to effect by ≈øuch a word and ≈øpirit? <hi>Iob</hi> 26.13. <hi>The Spirit is ≈øaid to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the worke of creation.</hi> Ioh. 14.26. and 15.26. All that the word hath ≈øaid, or Father promi≈øed, ≈øhall bee taught, te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and remembred vnto vs by Gods ≈øpirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10.11 13.14.15.16.26. &amp;c. A Spirit of life quickens tho≈øe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies that are redeemed by Chri≈øt, by whom they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3808:77"/>liue againe, and are led in prayer as children of adoption, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. All gifts and graces wee haue from the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. the Spirit is ≈øaid to dwell; for, as the Father makes choice of his hou≈øe, and the ≈øonne purcha≈øeth it, ≈øo the holy Gho≈øt takes po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, in ca≈øting out Satan and ≈øinne, and in keeping and holding the ≈øame in ≈øpite of all Satans a≈ø≈øaults. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3. A lie again≈øt the truth, is a ≈øpeciall ≈øinne again≈øt the holy Gho≈øt, who≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke is to te≈øtifie of the veritie he hath receiued from the Father and the Sonne. And hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that ≈øinning after the knowledge of the truth is mo≈øt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becau≈øe it is oppo≈øite to the la≈øt act of God, further then which he will not goe in the addition of any new ≈øupply of grace and goodne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What may wee learne for conclu≈øion of all this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That to him the worke is e≈øpecially giuen, in whom the manner of working doth mo≈øt appeare,</hi> as Creation to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Redemption to the Sonne, and Sanctification to the holy Gho≈øt. This may a little be manife≈øted vnto vs out of man, who is ≈øaid to doe all things by his <hi>wit, will,</hi> and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The fir≈øt mouer of man to action is will, then by wit and wi≈øedome he proceeds, and by his power concludes. The will workes by wit and power: wit workes from the will by power, and the power workes from them both. Will begins, wit di≈øpen≈øeth, and power doth fini≈øh the action. Onely here is the difference, that they are not alwayes able to worke in≈øeparably; for, ≈øometimes a man hath more wit then will; <hi>Agrippa,</hi> (Act. 26.28.) had more wit to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded to be a Chri≈øtian, then will to imbrace ≈øo dangerous a profe≈ø≈øion. Sometimes he hath more will then wit, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Mat. 16.22. <hi>Ma≈øter ≈øpare thy ≈øelfe;</hi> loue made him blind, in ≈øeeing what was fit for Chri≈øt to doe. Sometimes againe more will and wit then power, as the Devill, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. in the temptation of our Sauiour, he ≈øhewed all his wit and will to trap our Sauiour, but he had not power thereunto: ≈øomtimes al≈øo there appeares more power then eyther wit or will, as in the Legion of vncleane Spirits, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3808:78"/>who carried the whole Herd of Swine head long into the Sea. By this wee may ≈øee the in≈øeparable co-operation of the three per≈øons, as through a crevis, or lettice, a little glimmering light of their di≈øtinct manner of working. The Father wills the thing to be done, hence in Scripture will is oftner giuen to the Father then any other per≈øon. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.11. Secondly, the Sonne being the wi≈øedome of the Father, di≈øpen≈øeth what the Father hath willed. And here wee v≈øually call the Sonne the wi≈øedome of the Father, and ≈øo indeed we finde him to be in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Thirdly, the holy Gho≈øt as the power of both, doth fini≈øh and con≈øummate their works; and ≈øo the Scripture ≈øtiles him the power of the Highe≈øt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. For as the Father did will that his Sonne ≈øhould take vpon him our fle≈øh, and as it was proper to the ≈øecond per≈øon to a≈ø≈øume: ≈øo the fini≈øhing of this worke in the la≈øt act of it was due to the Spirit: for as there is a naturall ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to vnite the body and ≈øoule together; ≈øo is there a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ≈øpirit, equall to the worke, to vnite the divinitie, and the humanitie of Chri≈øt together. God wills that his ≈øonne a≈ø≈øume, and his ≈øonne will not a≈ø≈øume, but by the worke of the Spirit. To conclude, nothing is done, no, not in their mo≈øt di≈øtinct manner of working, but they will all haue an hand in it: what more proper to the ≈øonne of God then to take our fle≈øh, and become our wi≈øedome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe, ≈øanctification, and redemption? And yet he can doe none of this, but from the will of his Father, and by the power of his Spirit.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Creation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the fir≈øt part of Gods externall efficiencie, whereby he made the world of nothing originally good.</hi> Gen. 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God made.</hi> Heb. 11.3. <hi>of things which did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</hi> Gen. 1.3. <hi>and they were very good.</hi> P≈øal. 33.6.7.8.9. and 146.6.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is here generally to be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That becau≈øe things here originally had their beginning, therefore the Fathers manner of working doth here pruicipally appeare, to whom the originall of all things is giuen.</hi> 1. Cor. 8.6. All are ≈øaid to be of the Father; ≈øo are they of the Sonne as God, but as a per≈øon he is not the originall, for in the ≈øame place it is ≈øaid, by the ≈øonne. And ≈øo in the Creed we giue all per≈øonally to the Father, vntill wee come to the worke of redemption; and here we are to learne, that the Apo≈øta≈øie of <hi>Adam</hi> was e≈øpecially again≈øt the Father, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3808:79"/>therefore could not he by way of ≈øatisfaction be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, for the per≈øon properly offended, cannot ≈øatisfie him≈øelfe by him≈øelfe, but by ≈øome other that mu≈øt come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and vs, and thus agrees it with the iu≈øtice of God, that we ≈øhould be reconciled by a ≈øecond per≈øon.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Did God make the world all at one in≈øtant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, but in the ≈øpace of ≈øixe times</hi> 24. <hi>houres,</hi> that wee might more di≈øtinctly con≈øider all his workes. And <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> giues a good rule, <hi>Succe≈ø≈øiverum non ≈øimul e≈øt e≈ø≈øe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio;</hi> God could haue created all at once, but in his wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he tooke daies for it. Some glimps of rea≈øon hereof we may aime at thus; as ≈øome creatures were to begin with the fir≈øt in≈øtant of time, ≈øo ≈øome others that they might not haue their principles together, were to haue ≈øomething goe before them, hence the con≈øtancie and incon≈øtancie of Gods creatures. The third heauen, and the Angels were of nece≈ø≈øitie to be created in the fir≈øt in≈øtant, that they might haue their perfection of matter and forme together, otherwi≈øe they ≈øhould be corruptible, for what≈øoeuer is of a preexi≈øtent matter, is re≈øoluble and ≈øubiect to corruption. But that which is immediately of nothing, is perfectly compo≈øed, hath no other change, but by the ≈øame hand to returne into nothing againe. It was therefore impo≈ø≈øible for the world to want a beginning, and improbable for the creatures to be all at once, and yet ≈øome to remaine incorruptible, and others corruptible. That the worke was of ≈øixe dayes continuance, is plaine by <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 20.11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is the worke di≈øtributed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Either into the adiuncts of time, as a worke of ≈øixe dayes, or into the e≈ø≈øentiall and integrall parts: as into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture con≈øtant, or incon≈øtant; or re≈øpecting the agent that gaue all, as well matter as forme, into <hi>Creation immediately perfect, or perfect by degrees.</hi> Gen. 1.1. In the beginning, or very fir≈øt moment of time, God created heauen and earth. Now by the oppo≈øite member in the di≈øtribution, largely di≈øcribed in the whole Chapter, we ≈øhall be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3808:79"/>that which is in ≈øilence pa≈ø≈øed over. Earth vpon which wee now tread was made the third day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be this which was made in the very beginning of the fir≈øt day: neither can this heauen be that which was made the ≈øecond day, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. It then remaines by iu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent to be the highe≈øt heauen, which at the very fir≈øt was made mo≈øt ab≈øolute and perfect. Secondly, the earth that was made at the very ≈øame in≈øtant, as a matter of all that was afterwards to be created, being all things in power, nothing in act, did from his owne center touch the third heauen in euery point and part of his out≈øide: &amp; that of nece≈ø≈øitie, lea≈øt any vacuitie, or emptine≈ø≈øe ≈øhould haue interpo≈øed it ≈øelfe within the compa≈ø≈øe of ≈øo great a continent; nature abhorring to yeeld nothing a place within the circle of ≈øome-thing. Therefore were the≈øe two as companions and friends, immediately made of God in the very beginning of the fir≈øt day. Further, it is ≈øaid of the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. that it was <hi>without forme and voyd;</hi> that is, as yet it had neither any e≈ø≈øentiall, or accidentall perfection. The Lord afterwards did forme it into the light, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan≈øe, (improperly called the firmament) the water and the earth. The≈øe foure were mediately created of the earth, and yet for their formes immediately from God of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Thus was the earth fir≈øt formed, the highe≈øt part of it mo≈øt apt to receiue <hi>light,</hi> the next <hi>ayre,</hi> the third, the forme of <hi>water,</hi> and the lowe≈øt the forme of <hi>earth.</hi> After the earth had receiued this perfection, it was filled in euery part of it with inhabitants, as aboue with ≈øtarres, &amp; foules, below with trees, bea≈øts, and fi≈øhes, &amp;c. But of the≈øe anone. I in≈øi≈øt here to proue by rea≈øon that which is a truth, not as yet clearely deliuered, and by many contradicted; I leaue all to cen≈øure, according to the evidence I ≈øhall giue. My meaning is not to binde any man vnto my opinion, I onely pre≈øent things, and lay them out, as it were, vpon a ≈øtall; neither is it meet I grow into choler with any man that giues me no credit, or di≈ø-likes my ware, that were to play the <hi>Pedant.</hi> Pa≈ø≈øion witne≈ø≈øeth, that it is not rea≈øon ≈øo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3808:80"/>to doe, and he that doth any thing out of pa≈ø≈øion, cannot well doe it out of rea≈øon. Why ≈øhould any bee angry with mee, that I am not altogether of his opinion, ≈øeeing I am not angry with him, becau≈øe he is not of mine? I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for my example, <hi>S. Ierome</hi> and <hi>S. Augu≈øtine</hi> in their di≈øputations, to whom it was no matter, who gained the day, they would both winne by vnder≈øtanding their errors. But why doe I thus draw my ≈øelfe from my taske? <hi>Let truth vphold her ≈øelfe by mildne≈ø≈øe, and be promoted by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> You haue heard that heaven and earth were made in the very in≈øtant and beginning of the fir≈øt day. That they are two oppo≈øite members in the worke of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is properly giuen to the one, mu≈øt not bee giuen to the other. The earth (≈øayth the Text) was without forme, and voyd; Heaven then had at the very fir≈øt his forme, and inhabitant, and therefore had the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at the ≈øame in≈øtant created with it; other places were in time before their in-dwellers: onely the third heaven, and the Angels were concreated; and the rea≈øon is, for that their perfections were equally of nothing. It could not ≈øtand with order, after the fini≈øhing of the third heauen, and entrance made to create of matter, afterward to fall off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and beginne to create ≈øub≈øtances of no matter. I meane, integrally, for their whole e≈ø≈øence, otherwi≈øe, the foure formes of the elements, and ≈øoule of man were of nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the creation of things immediately made perfect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he made them of nothing with their principles together,</hi> that is, their matter and forme were put together of Almightie God, not ≈øuffering the one to enter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition before the other. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning he made,</hi> not giuing the one a beginning before the other. The ≈øame individuall time was the mea≈øure of both. Our bodies and ≈øoules may part a≈øunder, becau≈øe in creation time did ≈øeparate them, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:3808:80"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are obnoxious and ≈øubiect to the motion of their owne nature onely by the power of God.</hi> No other force is able to worke vpon them, or de≈øtroy their beings. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.19.20. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. The place and the life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are both incorruptible, ≈øubiect to no alteration, change or mutation. Angels are too quicke and ready in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ≈øuffer of any but God, he onely is nimble enough, to meet them, and ma≈øter them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What el≈øe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are onely ≈øubiect, in regard of their e≈ø≈øence to creation and annihilation,</hi> that is, by the ≈øame hand they may be made nothing, as they were of nothing made ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 40.15. God can takeaway his creature as ea≈øily as the winde doth a little du≈øt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What yet further may be ob≈øerued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are in them≈øelues no wayes liable to generation, or corruption.</hi> They can neither receiue new formes, or loo≈øe their old; for that matter cannot admit of diver≈øe formes, which it ≈øelfe was never depriued of his owne. So complete is the vnion, that the matter hath not ≈øo much as the lea≈øt inclination to any other perfection, then it receiues at the fir≈øt in≈øtant, by the hand of the Creator, and excellencie of his forme. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.30. The idle que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> concerning mariage in heauen, and procreation of children, is fully an≈øwered by our Sauiour, both in regard of the nature of the place, and his fir≈øt inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. <hi>In the re≈øurrection of the dead, they neither marry, nor are giuen in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in beauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When were the≈øe things created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the fir≈øt moment of time:</hi> for as they had no ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of time, for the receiuing of their e≈ø≈øentiall parts: ≈øo God tooke the very fir≈øt beginning for their creation. The ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of time being left to other creatures, of a cleane contrary nature. Angels are not ≈øimply eternall, becau≈øe they haue a beginning, &amp; yet they are immortall, becau≈øe nature can never ≈øever their parts, or divide them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3808:81"/>a≈øunder. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning he made the heauen, &amp;c.</hi> Perfect for forme, and that it might not be voyd, like the earth, filled it with mo≈øt excellent inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the things ≈øo made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The third heaven, and the Angels,</hi> Colo≈ø. 1.16.

This onely is to be called Firmament, as not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any creature, whereas the other two heavens vnder it are to be pa≈ø≈øed through by the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt bodies.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the Angels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he created them at once and together in the third heaven, immediately of nothing, with the greate≈øt perfections of nature, to the end they might prai≈øe him together, and become his mini≈øtring Spirits, and Me≈ø≈øengers, as he ≈øhould haue occa≈øion to ≈øend them.</hi> Heb. 1.7. He made them for perfection of nature Spirits, and for office, his mo≈øt immediate Mini≈øters, and for execution, more ready then any flame of fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.

               <p>Q. <hi>With what properties hath he enriched them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>With the greate≈øt per≈øpicuitie of rea≈øon, and acutene≈ø≈øe of wit, libertie of will, ≈øtrength and ≈øpeed of motion, that is po≈ø≈øible, or incident to created nature.</hi> Mat. 18.10. They are ≈øayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to behold the face of God: ≈øo cleare vnder≈øtandings that they quickly perceiue what God would haue done: yet of ≈øome things are they ignorant. <hi>Mar:</hi> 13.32. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever they know is by reflection, either of Gods face vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gla≈ø≈øe of their mindes, or the beames of it, as they ≈øhine in the creatures; the one is by immediate revelation, the other, by inqui≈øition and di≈øcour≈øe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. It is true, that Angels ≈øee both the face of God, and the face of things, and then the face of them≈øelues; and hence it is, that they know nothing in them≈øelues, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God reveales it, or them≈øelues doe finde it in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and by meanes hereof they learne much in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and his workes; and hauing ≈øo neere a pre≈øence with his Maie≈øty, mu≈øt needs out-≈øtrip others that are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, I meane, in re≈øpect of divine Revelation.

               <p>An. <hi>It is whereby he made them of a preexi≈øtent matter, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going principles.</hi> They are not immediately compo≈øed, but fir≈øt they haue a matter, and then a forme, and then their owne being, or exi≈øting. And as time di≈ø-ioynes the≈øe things, ≈øo they are ≈øubiect to change with time. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. Out of the voyde and vnformed earth came all incon≈øtant and mutable creatures. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. The earth that now is, is ≈øayd to ≈øtand out of that <hi>Chaos,</hi> which <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. is called earth, water, &amp;c.

               <p>Q. <hi>What followeth hereupon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That they are by nature returnable into their former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ≈øo of a corruptible nature.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.6. <hi>The world that then was peri≈øhed, being over-flowed with the waters,</hi> that is, all that breathed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.22. Euery thing vnder the Sunne pa≈ø≈øeth away. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.4. And at the la≈øt day, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with all their inhabitants ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. As it were, a re≈øolution being made into the fir≈øt <hi>Chaos</hi> againe, as may ≈øeeme, what a hell were it for a man to be an inhabitant of that fir≈øt earth? The holy Gho≈øt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifieth, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. that <hi>the heavens and the earth, which are now, are kept in ≈øtore, and re≈øerved for fire and perdition of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men at the la≈øt day.</hi> Good rea≈øon they ≈øhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed where they ≈øinned, and with tho≈øe creatures they haue abu≈øed. A fearefull hell to haue all turned into the fir≈øt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3808:83"/>Chaos, with an addition of the fire of Gods vengeance. As if that fir≈øt matter were then to be formed and filled with nothing but the extremities of Gods cur≈øes. At the fir≈øt it was formed, and adorned as a Palace and Paradi≈øe for man, then ≈øhall it be left as a dungeon and noy≈øome pri≈øon, for the torture and torment of all wretched and wicked per≈øons. Onely the third heauen, with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, ≈øhall then be in bli≈ø≈øe and ble≈ø≈øed felicitie.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How manifold is this creation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is eyther of the <hi>elements,</hi> or the <hi>elementaries.</hi> Gen. 2.1. Heauen and earth were fini≈øhed with the ho≈øt of them. All that are placed aboue in the fire, and the ayre, or below in the waters and the earth, are elementaries, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed out of tho≈øe foure elements, and are as the ho≈øt of this inferiour world.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the creation of the elements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he made them of a precedent matter, with their formes, immediately of nothing.</hi> That is, the matter, or earth without forme, receiued into euery part and portion of it a ≈øimple formation, without all mixture, yet ≈øo, that it was formed into foure bodies, e≈ø≈øentially di≈øtingui≈øhed, which are mo≈øt ≈øimple, as hauing nothing in them but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter, with foure di≈øtinct formes, immediately crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of nothing: hence they are in them≈øelues the greate≈øt oppo≈øits, as fire to water, and ayre to earth. The maine oppo≈øites are fire and water, which ≈øtickle and ≈øtriue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are moderated and compounded by the two other. When water would quench the fire, earth ≈øteps in and helpes to abate his moy≈øture. And when fire would dry vp his moy≈øture, ayre ≈øecondeth the water, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a radicall moy≈øture to feed the fire a little longer. When the coldne≈ø≈øe of water takes off the edge of heat, then ayre with his mild heat helpeth his fellow. And when fire over-ma≈øters the coldne≈ø≈øe of water, then earth checks him, and abates his fury, whence ari≈øeth all elementaries, receiuing the common matter, and formes of the elements, much abated and moderated, after their ≈øtriuing and ≈øtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3808:83"/>together, and therefore are not ≈øo vehemently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite and contrary in them≈øelues. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Let there bee light,</hi> which was the fir≈øt ≈øimple forme that was put into the common matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Let there be an <hi>expan≈øe,</hi> or <hi>≈øprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> which was next added to light, as his fitte≈øt neighbour, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Let there be <hi>gatherings,</hi> or <hi>waters,</hi> which contained the third ≈øimple forme, &amp; came as next fellow to the ayre; for ≈øo God had appointed, that by placing it betweene two great adver≈øaries, it might be a friend to both. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Let the dry appeare,</hi> which comes lowe≈øt in ranke, and gaue the matter the fourth ≈øimple forme. Thus heat and cold, moy≈øture and drine≈ø≈øe, did runne through the fir≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter, which intertaines them all, and giues them leaue to diffu≈øe them≈øelues one into another, for further mixture and compo≈øition.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But may the≈øe things be handled in Divinitie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, becau≈øe, <hi>wee ≈øo farre ≈øpeake of them as they concerne creation,</hi> which is proper to this Art. And our rule is this, that where Creation endeth, nature beginneth; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ≈øucceeds it, as in imitation of Gods fir≈øt compo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God by his omnipotent hand giues to euery thing his being, and then ≈øets it a worke, by his owne nature and vertue. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> knew a fir≈øt matter, but he confe≈ø≈øeth, he had it from <hi>Plato,</hi> and he from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and they from <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> Yet he erred in many things, for want of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, beginning onely with nature, where creation had ended his worke. Fir≈øt, he was ignorant that the fir≈øt matter was of nothing. Secondly, that it ≈øtood certaine houres without a forme. Thirdly, that all the formes it receiued were immediately of nothing. Fourthly, that all this was done in time, and that there was nothing in the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, but the maker of it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.2. The earth was a ≈øubiect of contrary formes, and therefore preexi≈øtent.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that fir≈øt matter of all incon≈øtant things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It was a thing which God made of nothing in the beginning of the fir≈øt day, without forme and voyd, and ≈øo by his ≈øpirit mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culou≈øly ≈øu≈øtained it for a certaine ≈øpace.</hi> Gen. 1.1.2.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:3808:84"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That of it ≈øelfe it is permanent,</hi> for being immediately of nothing, it hath no power to worke vpon it, but the ≈øame that made it, therefore God alone can turne it into nothing, from whence he brought it, and this is the rea≈øon why the fir≈øt matter, and foure fir≈øt formes are not re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though all things may be re≈øolved into them. For in generation and corruption, as they begin here to take new formes, ≈øo here they leaue them againe. And death, though a privation of life, yet it hath no power to annihilate his contrary, and therefore, as nature begins where creation ends, ≈øo creation at the la≈øt day will begin againe where nature hath ended. I meane, in our re≈øurrection, euery man receiuing againe tho≈øe very peeces of the elements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was made. <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.27. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35.36.37.38. &amp;c. the very ≈øeed that is ≈øowne, dieth and ri≈øeth againe, out of tho≈øe very elements into which nature re≈øolueth it, ≈øpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it againe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When was it made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the fir≈øt beginning of time, or the evening of the fir≈øt day,</hi> hence it is co-etaneall, and of the ≈øame time and age with the third heaven, and the Angels. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. And the rea≈øon was, to hinder a vacuitie in the large ≈øpace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe of that highe≈øt heaven. The parts whereof would ≈øooner haue fallen together, then haue admitted nothing to ≈øtand within their circle. For nothing, and evill, are cou≈øin germans, and equally oppo≈øed to the being of any thing, rather would perfection haue imperfection his next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if ≈øo be, it haue a being from God, then to permit nothing to lodge in his bo≈øome. And therefore what a degenerate thing is man, to admit evill for his be≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How long was this matter voyd, and without forme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>All the time that darkne≈ø≈øe was vpon the face of it:</hi> Now the vici≈ø≈øitude of light and darkne≈ø≈øe makes the day and night, which as it is mo≈øt probable, were then Equinoctiall, of an equall length and ≈øize; that is, twelue houres a peece.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3808:84"/>So then the earth, or fir≈øt matter ≈øtood in that imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a whole night, or twelue houres. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.2.5. invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in nothing but palpable darkene≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How was it pre≈øerued all that time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By the Spirit that moued vpon it,</hi> and which in ≈øtead of a forme, did cheri≈øh and fo≈øter it all that time. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What kind of creature may we tearme it to be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Some-thing potentially, nothing actually.</hi> It was all things, and nothing. A matter for all, yet nothing in forme. It is called earth, and water. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.2. And ≈øo it was fire and ayre, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What be the kinds of elements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The higher and hotter which make one globe, or the lower and colder which make another.</hi> So that all the world is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp in three ≈øeverall globes, one comprehending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The divine globe of the third heaven, in which God is ≈øaid to ≈øit. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.4. as a place of ble≈ø≈øed re≈øt. The ≈øecond is the etheriall, or skie globe, containing tho≈øe glorious lampes, and burning torches, by who≈øe light and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe all this inferior world is comforted; and vpon this heaven the Lord is ≈øaid to ride. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 68.4. in regard of his ≈øwift motion and expedite manner of working. The third and inferior globe, which is but as a point to the re≈øt, is the earthie and watery ≈øphere, and the Lord is ≈øaid to ≈øit vpon the very circle of it. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 40.22. And to ≈øhake the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of it, as it were, by a canva≈øe, or as a man tumbles a thing out of his lap. <hi>Iob</hi> 38.13. Thus is God in all the globes of the world, no where included, no where exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he is in their circles, and vpon their circles, di≈ø-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing all things as he plea≈øeth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the higher and hotter elements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby they were made with formes, more actiue and ≈øtirring;</hi> and therefore hotter and higher then the re≈øt. Hence in regard of levitie and gravitie, heaven is ≈øaid to be aboue, and earth below. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4.

               <p>Q. <hi>What are the kinds of the more formall elements?</hi>

God naming them by that which is mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible to vs, and in them mo≈øt proper, as light is to fire, exten≈øion and expan≈øion to the ayre.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the Fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby God made it in the top and highe≈øt part of the fir≈øt matter, with the mo≈øt actiue and working forme, ≈øo that it is mo≈øt hot and light;</hi> therefore in the highe≈øt roome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of his ≈øhining, is called, <hi>Photi≈øticos.</hi> With ≈øuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is the fire deiected, that it ≈øtrikes into the bowels of the earth, and bottome of the Sea; as may well appeare by the generation of ≈øtones and fi≈øhes.

Hence Phylo≈øophers attribute the engendring of gold to the <hi>Sunne;</hi> of ≈øilver, to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> lead, to the <hi>Moon,</hi> copper to <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp;c. Likewi≈øe pretious ≈øtones could not be ≈øo re≈øplendent and glorious, if it were not for the worke of the light, or fire, that penetrates into their ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places and veines. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3.

               <p>Q. <hi>How did the light de≈øcend from aboue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>For three dayes, by the power of God alone, afterwards by the Sunne, Moone, and Starres,</hi> which were ≈øet of God in the element of fire. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4. <hi>God divided the light from the darkene≈ø≈øe,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to devide the day from the night, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If we ≈øpeake truely and properly, it is the time of the Sunnes remaining aboue the <hi>Horizon,</hi> or vi≈øible part of the world. Some, whom I haue cau≈øe much to re≈øpect and reuerence, haue held opinion, that light naturally a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and violently de≈øcendeth by a kinde of repercu≈ø≈øion made by the Sunnes body and motion, then accordingly haue defined the day to be the time wherein the light is turned downeward, or reflected vpon the lower parts of the world, and ≈øo by conden≈øation ≈øhineth. But others vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more mature con≈øideration, iudge that a new devi≈øed way. For, fir≈øt, Light in its owne nature cannot be ≈øaid to a≈øcend or de≈øcend onely, but transfu≈øeth it ≈øelfe equally &amp; ≈øpherically in all dimen≈øions from its owne center. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the ≈øhining of the Sunne be nothing el≈øe but the beating backward of the a≈øcending beames of the whole skie, or element of fire, ≈øurely the Moone would alwayes ≈øeeme full, as the Sunne doth, being that this a≈øcending light mu≈øt needs in like maner meere with the thicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Moone, and ≈øuffer repercu≈ø≈øion from it. Thirdly, though light were made vi≈øible in the maner imagined, yet the day cannot properly be defined the time, wherein the light is reflected by the Sunne vpon the lower parts of the world for this is done perpetually and ≈øo wee ≈øhould haue no night.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If we giue way to evident rea≈øon, and experience, we mu≈øt needs acknowledge the night to be nothing el≈øe, but the ≈øhadow of the earth, that is, the privation of light made by the earths thicke body, intercepting and cutting off the Sunnes beames. They that are of the fore≈øaid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, define night to be the time wherein the light retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpward, a≈øcending backe againe to the place where God fir≈øt created it: which is as a paradoxe, ≈øo an vndefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible <hi>Tenent</hi> both for the rea≈øons aboue≈øaid, as al≈øo for that in this de≈øcription, there is no efficient, or materiall cau≈øe implyed, which ≈øhould make the light returne vpward, &amp; a≈øcend backe againe. La≈øtly, there is no re≈øpectiue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made of the diver≈øe parts of the Globe of the earth. Whereupon, it may be ≈øuppo≈øed, that he that made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, did not con≈øider the earth &amp; heauens to be ≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, and ≈øo to make vici≈ø≈øitude of day and night in the moiety of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How called God the Night?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He called it <hi>Lailah,</hi> which ≈øignifieth re≈øting, becau≈øe he made the night for man to re≈øt in.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did God order the≈øe things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He appointed them to keepe their cour≈øe, making a ≈øeparation betweene them, ≈øetting them, as it were, their limites, which they might not pa≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is this ≈øeparation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The ≈øeparation betweene the day and the night is the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, betweene the night and the day, the morning.</hi> Gen. 1.5 Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ≈øeparates by darkene≈ø≈øe, morning by light. So that the one di≈ø-ioynes the day from the night, and the other the night from the day. Onely the fir≈øt euening ≈øeparated not, becau≈øe the light was then vncreated: yet was it of God appointed even then as apt to ≈øtand betwixt light and darkene≈ø≈øe. <hi>And thus from the euening and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the fir≈øt day fini≈øhed, con≈øi≈øting of</hi> 24. <hi>houres.</hi> In the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3808:86"/>fir≈øt evening were heaven and earth created: and in the fir≈øt morning, the light, or element of fire. The ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time will keepe vs from that foule confu≈øion about heaven and earth: which are ≈øo frequently expounded of the workes that followed vpon other dayes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the ayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby God made it in the next part of the fir≈øt matter, mo≈øt moy≈øt, and of a diffu≈øiue, or diffluent nature, ≈øpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, both for impletion and ≈øeparation.</hi> P≈øal. 104.2. <hi>He ≈øprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the heavens like a curtaine:</hi> that is, the ayre, (for he had ≈øpoken of the light before) which is further called a ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior chamber, very ≈øpatious, and containes (as it were) a beame for the hanging of the clouds. For water is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cold, and therefore gathereth it ≈øelfe together in the middle region, and by helpe of the ayre is held vp, which maketh a partition betwixt tho≈øe waters that are congeled aboue, and that are fluide and floating below. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.7. for the cloudes hang by vertue of cold, both in the place, and of that which is in vapours, being watery, and a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the violence of the Sunne beames redoubled, which when they returne ≈øingle, leaue their vapours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, which are held by the place, till the fire &amp; light returning di≈ø≈øolue the bands, and ≈øend them downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in raine, or ≈øome ≈øuch like moy≈øt Meteor. <hi>Iob</hi> 38.31. <hi>Can≈øt thou bind the ≈øweete influences of Pleiades? or loo≈øe the bands of Orion.</hi> This is nothing but the neat and cold that rules in the ayre, and earth, when the≈øe brumall, or ae≈øtivall ≈øtarres are mo≈øt to be ≈øeene in our haemi≈øphere. <hi>Orion</hi> is ≈øeene all night in the moneth of December, and ≈øo on, till the Spring, le≈ø≈øe, or more. The <hi>Pleiades</hi> begin with the Spring, and la≈øt till Autumne, when <hi>Acturus</hi> takes place. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.9. So then as cold bindes vp all in Winter, becau≈øe of the Sunnes ab≈øence: ≈øo heat loo≈øeth againe, when the Sunne returneth in the Spring. And as below, ≈øo aboue, cold knits the clouds, and heat breakes their knots.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How called he it being made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the name in Hebrew, <hi>Shamaijm,</hi> which ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3808:87"/>there be waters, ≈øealing thereby the office in deviding betwixt the two waters. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.7.8. Hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe that raine water is farre more fruitful to the earth then any other, becau≈øe it is not di≈ø≈øolved by the light, but it brings downe with it much ayery moy≈øture, which is fatter then leane water; and we ≈øee by experience, that one ≈øhower is better then much watering.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When was it made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the ≈øecond</hi> 24. <hi>houres,</hi> God taking (as it were) a whole day for that which was equally capable of light and darkene≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.8. <hi>So the euening and the morning were the ≈øecond day,</hi> by an equall ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of light and darkene≈ø≈øe. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. God in the fir≈øt day made light to ≈øhine out of darkene≈ø≈øe, when there was no capable ≈øubiect for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of it; now he ≈øtayes a whole day of 24. houres, for light and darkene≈ø≈øe to come and goe in a proper ≈øubiect. Oh then how ≈øhould we tru≈øt this God to ≈øhine in our hearts, even when we are mo≈øt vncapable?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the creation of the colder elements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he created them with formes le≈ø≈øe actiue, and therefore colder;</hi> the≈øe elements are clogged with more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then forme, and therefore the action of them is much hindred. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heare, O earth,</hi> the dulle≈øt of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is brought to convince man of di≈øobedience, which ≈øhould be the mo≈øt forward.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Water and earth.</hi> Gen. 1.9. <hi>Let the waters be gathered, and let the drie appeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the water?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby it was made in the lower part of the fir≈øt matter mo≈øt cold, and moi≈øt.</hi> His cold appeares to be greate≈øt by his gathering, and his moy≈øture in this, that it is fluide, and of a ≈øpreading nature, yet much inferior to the ayre, as may appeare by putting our hands into oyle and water, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe by pictures, which hold their colours the longer, for that they are laid in oyle. Now becau≈øe water ≈øooner dries vp then oyle, it is plaine, that ayre which is predominant in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3808:87"/>oyle is moy≈øter then water. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Let the waters vnder the heaven be gathered together,</hi> this is done by the cold of them and therefore no wonder to ≈øee the Seas tumble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is this water devided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Into the waters aboue, and the waters beneath.</hi> Gen. 1.6. And it is probable, that both the≈øe waters met together in <hi>Noahs</hi> flood. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.20. with 11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What meane you by the waters aboue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The clouds, and what≈øoeuer water is aboue in the ayre.</hi> Gen. 1.6. P≈øal. 104.3. and 148.4. For as cold gathers them below, ≈øo aboue, &amp;c. and may very well be called Gods botels, as containing all tho≈øe gatherings. <hi>Iob</hi> 38.37.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What meane you by the waters beneath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Sea, and all the waters here below.</hi> P≈øal. 33.7. <hi>Hee gathereth the waters of the Sea together, as vpon an heape, and layeth vp the depths in his trea≈øure.</hi> P≈øal. 104.6.7.8.9. Iob 26.12. and 38.8.9.10.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the proper place of the water?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>To be next vnder the ayre, and next aboue the earth:</hi> yet their proper place by Gods appointment is to keepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the earth, as in a ce≈øterne, and that not by a miracle, but by a law of nature; for the word <hi>gather,</hi> comes of <hi>Kavah,</hi> and pa≈ø≈øiuely ≈øignfies a confluxe of waters. God therefore bidding the waters caue, did fir≈øt make them a Ce≈øterne in the bowels of the earth, and that was by the a≈øcent of the mountaines, and de≈øcent of the valleyes. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.8.9. Hither at Gods rebuke they caue and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them≈øelues, by their coldne≈ø≈øe, which is of a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating nature. Hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that wee haue the pure≈øt fountaines at footes of hills; and that often out of their ≈øides great ≈øtore of waters haue broken forth, to the de≈øtruction of the inhabitants. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. At <hi>Noahs</hi> flood all the fountaines of the great deepe were broken vp: which may very well be vnder≈øtood of the bur≈øting of the mountaines, to let in the waters. Againe, from the Seas come all the ≈øweet Springs that run betweene the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3808:88"/>and water the valleyes. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.10.11.12. which as it were, ≈øweating through the bodies of the huge moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, are purged of their ≈øaltne≈ø≈øe, and leaue behind them what they had contracted by the continuall working of the Sunne beames, and their owne agitation in to≈ø≈øing too and fro. Againe, for the fluxe and refluxe of the ≈øea, which is nothing but the ri≈øing and falling of it, the one being violent, and the other naturall, is ea≈øily vnder≈øtood by the cau≈øe of both. The fluxe, or tyde is violent, cau≈øed by the Starres, more e≈øpecially the Moone, who≈øe heat being weaker then the Sunne, hath her beames returned with greater oppo≈øition, yet prevailing, as being more actiue then water, gets vp her fumes and vapours, and with them lifts vp the water, and carrying them after her, makes the water follow her, and ≈øo they thru≈øt forward the water that is before them, vntill they be cleane gotten out of the Sea, and then the water fals againe of it owne accord, and the refluxe, or the ebbe is naturall, moy≈øture and coldnes making it runne downeward. Thus the Lord keepes the Seas in a perpetuall motion, lea≈øt by ≈øtanding they ≈øhould corrupt, to the de≈øtruction of the whole earth. It is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to be neglected, which is ≈øaid of Starres, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our bodies, which is not in regard of their owne influences, but their exhalations. For all the Starres worke by the heat they ca≈øt downe, which being nothing el≈øe but the element of fire, cannot of them≈øelues otherwi≈øe hurt, or heale, but according to their temper and degree of heat. As for example, <hi>Saturne</hi> ≈øends downe a weake heat, and rai≈øeth fumes from pooles of water, and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and carries them vp into the cold region of the ayre, being able to bring them no higher; and ≈øo they affect the ayre fir≈øt, and then our bodies by it with cold and drine≈ø≈øe, two enemies to life, con≈øi≈øting in heat, and moy≈øture; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ≈øay, it is <hi>fatall</hi> to be borne vnder his regiment; and to ≈øucke, as it were, our fir≈øt breath from him. Hence fabulous Poets faine him eating a child, onely a better Starre, which they call <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by his heat and breath, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3808:88"/>with a ≈øtone chokes him. This Starre is brighter then the other, and more ≈øolide to ca≈øt downe his beames; hence from him comes a greater heat, and rai≈øeth vp more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours from <hi>Meeres,</hi> which are more ≈øweet and plea≈øant, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to draw our fir≈øt breath vnder ≈øuch a planet they count whole≈øome, and a progno≈øticke of good fortune. <hi>Mars,</hi> another planet, of a reddi≈øh and fiery nature, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth downe more ≈øolide heat and fire, and inflames the fumes and vapours it rai≈øeth, and therefore they deeme ≈øuch as draw in the fir≈øt ayre, vnder ≈øuch a con≈øtellation, ≈øhall afterward proue men of a word and a blow, &amp;c. The <hi>Sunne</hi> being of the greate≈øt ≈øtrength, is able to fetch vp vapours from the bottome of the Sea, and lowe≈øt bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, and turne them into the nature of ayre, making them, according to their matter, plea≈øant, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. As fumes of gold and precious ≈øtones may bee cordiall; of other Mineralls, like deadly damps that Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øts often meete withall. <hi>Venus</hi> like <hi>Iupiter</hi> rai≈øeth vp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which falling in the night, cheri≈øh, and nouri≈øh plants, and ≈øo is ≈øayd to be fruitfull, and the mother of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpring. This I thought good to admoni≈øh all concerning the conceit of Starres, of I know not what influences; when the truth is, they are all but in≈øtruments of ≈øending downe light and fire, and according to their ≈øeverall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions and placing in this element, ≈øend downe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or le≈ø≈øer quantitie of heat, the qualitie being all one. Chri≈øt ≈øayes his locks are full of the dew of the night, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Moone hath not the ≈øame regiment over the night in regard of heat, that the Sunne hath over the day. And Phy≈øitians teach, that it is dangerous to ≈øleepe with our heads in the Moone-≈øhine, for feare of the moy≈øt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempers of the braine. And we ≈øee in the lunacie, that the franticke and madde moode followes the ≈øea≈øons of the Moone. So that ≈øome-thing is to be giuen to the Starres, and yet no more then is to be wrought by the naturall qualitie of heat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VVE haue heard of the elements, what are the elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An≈øwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereby God made them of the≈øe foure elements, by a mixture.</hi> Gen. 1.11. <hi>Let the earth bring forth, &amp;c.</hi> This was impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without heat and moy≈øture, therefore other elements were in the compo≈øition, as may appeare by the re≈øolution of plants, out of which water and ≈øpirit is to be di≈øtilled, &amp;c. The my≈øtery of this mixture may thus bee conceiued. Fir≈øt, water being of a running nature, is ≈øtayed by earths drine≈ø≈øe. Secondly, earth being dry in the highe≈øt degree would de≈øtroy waters moy≈øture, being not an≈øwerable to his quality in the ≈øame degree, therefore ayre comes in and takes part with water, to moderate his exce≈ø≈øiue drine≈ø≈øe. Thirdly, the coldne≈ø≈øe of water and earth together would ea≈øily extingui≈øh the heat of the ayre, except fire, the greate≈øt champion ≈øhould ≈øtep in and helpe the ayre again≈øt them both. And tho≈øe all foure being clo≈øed together, fight it out, vntill the quarrell be taken vp by euery one yeelding a little to another, and remitting their forces, vntill they all meete louingly together in the ≈øame elementary compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, which is as a compound of them all. But you will ≈øay, this is rather Generation then Creation, and therefore a foule confu≈øion to bring it among≈øt divine precepts. I an≈øwere; The action of euery creature is but an imitable gene≈øis, or corre≈øpondent work-man≈øhip to Gods: and therefore in euery thing, the fir≈øt cour≈øe is extraordinary, God ≈øhewing the creature his way of imitation. Therefore all the elementaries were made of God, though hee gaue commandement to the elements to bring them forth.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>How devide you the≈øe clementaries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are either <hi>animate,</hi> or <hi>inanimate,</hi> things with life, or without life: God ≈øhewing him≈øelfe by his worke, to be both life and being. Now becau≈øe God proceeds to perfection, let vs fir≈øt ≈øee the more imperfect elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the inanimate elementaries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby they were made out of the elements without parts,</hi> that is, a body and a ≈øoule. I confe≈ø≈øe, ≈øome di≈øpute is about <hi>Mineralls,</hi> which containe in them excellent ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and are found very vivificall in cordialls: but yet this is no proper life, neither will it follow, that they haue a vegetatiue life, becau≈øe they ≈øeeme to grow; for, that is onely by addition of matter, and not a liuely exten≈øion of the ≈øame matter by a ≈øpringing life, increa≈øing to his full perfection, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are they devided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are either <hi>Meteors,</hi> or <hi>Mineralls:</hi> for ≈øo it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that the≈øe things which haue onely a body and no ≈øoule, are either of elements well ioyned together, or el≈øe of ≈øuch as hang very loo≈øely together, and are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily ≈øhaken a≈øunder: the≈øe things are pa≈ø≈øed over in ≈øilence by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and might well be left out of this Art, ≈øaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God doth wonderfully ≈øet forth his glory, even by the weake≈øt workes, and tho≈øe that are wor≈øt tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their compo≈øition. We will therefore ≈øtay a little in the handling of them; for their knowledge ≈øhall be both plea≈øant and profitable.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the Meteors?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>All luch things as are mixed of the foure elements imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</hi> Gen. 1.6. Of this kinde are the waters aboue. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. &amp; the raine that de≈øcends from them. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 148. Clouds, fire, haile, ≈ønow, winde, and vapours are called vpon to pray≈øe the Lord, becau≈øe he created them. What marvells doe we meete withall in this head of creatures? the clouds, the bottles of raine, ve≈ø≈øels as thin as the liquor which is contained in them: there they hang and moue, though
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3808:90"/>weightie with their burden. The≈øe the Lord maketh one while as ≈øome ayery Seas to hold water: another while as ≈øome ayery Furnaces, whence he ≈øcattereth his ≈øudden fires vnto all the parts of the earth, a≈øtoni≈øhing the world with the fearefull noyies of the thunders eruption: out of the mid≈øt of the waters aboue he fetcheth fire, and hard ≈øtones. Another while hee makes the clouds as ≈øteele-gla≈ø≈øes, wherein the Sunne lookes and ≈øhewes his face in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of colours which he hath not; there are the ≈øtreames of light, blazing and falling Starres, fires darted vp and downe in many formes, hollow openings, and (as it were) gulfes in the skie; bright circles about the Moone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets, Snowes, Haile, &amp;c. Here might I di≈øcour≈øe of a world of wonders, to the a≈øtoni≈øhment of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: but I mu≈øt remember my Art, which is to ≈øpeake of Creation, and not the generation of things; for as the one belongs to Divinitie, ≈øo the other to naturall Phylo≈øophy. And I take it that Meteors were rather generated of the foure elements, then created: though in all wee are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Gods hand, though we cannot ≈øearch out his action. But if God lend life, as I de≈øire fir≈øt to acquaint men more fully with the knowledge of <hi>Iehovah-Elohim;</hi> ≈øo after with their workes. And Creation, according to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription, will yeeld the exacte≈øt and divine≈øt Phylo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the perfect mixture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby the bodies of things are more clo≈øely vnited, and produced according to the predominant element, not hanging by violence out of their proper elements, but duely placed of God in their proper places, whereby the fir≈øt matter is filled and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> God him≈øelfe ≈øupplying that voyd and vnformed ma≈ø≈øe, with foure formes, and infinite varieties of creatures out of their compo≈øition and mixture. They which lie the lowe≈øt, and doe adorne the bowels of the earth, wee call Mineralls; and they are either Metalls, or Stones, the one hath water predominant in it, the other earth; and they are both precious, and ba≈øe, purer, or impurer. And it is to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3808:91"/>be wondered at, that man treading vpon the≈øe Mineralls, ≈øhould not learne to contemne them. They lie furthe≈øt from heaven, and the be≈øt of them are in <hi>India,</hi> furthe≈øt from the Church. It is (as we haue ≈øaid) that which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianiti≈øh</hi> Camels carry, that Indian ≈ølaues get, that ≈øervile Apprenti≈øes worke, that greedy Iewes ≈øwallow, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings admire, and Ruffians ≈øpend: and yet we cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteem of it as the meane≈øt of Gods creatures, far inferior to a ≈øpire of gra≈ø≈øe. <hi>Adam</hi> had them in the fir≈øt Paradi≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.11.12. In the ≈øecond we ≈øhall not need them. <hi>Iob</hi> 28.1.2.3.5.6. &amp;c. There may you ≈øee how God hath placed them, and how we come by them. And ≈øo ≈øubiect to ≈øinne, as God made a law to haue them purified, before he would haue them v≈øed. <hi>Num.</hi> 31.22.23. &amp;c. Hence it is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of the≈øe things to make Idoll gods. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the elementaries with life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby they were created of a body and ≈øoule;</hi> for life is nothing but the act of the ≈øoule vpon the body: and the ≈øoule, ≈øaue onely the rea≈øonable, is compounded of the foure elements, and is nothing but the Spirits of them, or that which is mo≈øt formall and actiue in them. Hence fire and ayre are mo≈øt predominant in the≈øe ≈øpirits; for, as by extraction we haue the ≈øpirits of things taken from the ma≈ø≈øe and body, by re≈øolution of the compo≈øition: ≈øo, in the compo≈øition, tho≈øe ≈øpirits were as the ≈øoule of that liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing. Wine is pre≈ø≈øed from the grape, which is the fruit of a vegetable plant: and becau≈øe it carries away with it the more formall elements, and leaues the gro≈ø≈øer and more materiall behind, wee ≈øay it is generous and full of Spirits: yea, and out of this againe by Art are taken the Spirits of wine, which are very liuely, and of a quickning nature. In all plants, Ayre is mo≈øt formall; and therefore the vegetatiue life con≈øi≈øts mo≈øt in moy≈øture, and the ≈øpirit of it: but in the Sen≈øatiue and Motiue life, fire, and the ≈øpirit thereof is mo≈øt predominant. The≈øe Spirits which are the ≈øoules of Plants, and Bea≈øts, are but the band, or
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3808:91"/>tye of the rea≈øonable ≈øoule and body: hence death in man is nothing but the extingui≈øhing, or con≈øuming of the≈øe Spirits: for as this cla≈øpe vnloo≈øeth, or knot vntieth: ≈øo body and ≈øoule ≈øeparate a≈øunder. Agues they con≈øume and backe the≈øe Spirits within our bodies, and ≈øo con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill vs: colds and watery di≈øtempers doe not ≈øo much wa≈øt as weary and tyre them, and at la≈øt extingui≈øh them as a brand in a puddle of water. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20.21.24.28. &amp;c. we read of life; and <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.22. wee heare how God extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed the ≈øame againe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the kinds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Either ≈øuch as liue a ≈øingle life, or a compound life.</hi> Some creatures haue their Spirits, or Soules from ≈øome one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formally, others from more. As for example, all Plants liue mo≈øt by the Spirit and moy≈øture of the ayre: Starres of the fire, men and bea≈øts by both. They grow by the one, haue ≈øen≈øe and motion by the other.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is this ≈øingle life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he made ≈øome creatures to line by the formall and act it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e Spirits of ≈øome one element.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are their kinds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Plants and lights,</hi> the one with a growing and ≈øprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging life, the other with a ≈øtirring, or mouing life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11. with 14. The fir≈øt being more imperfect (as ayre is le≈ø≈øe formall then fire) is fir≈øt handled.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the Plants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby the earth brought them forth with a≈øpringing life onely.</hi> Gen. 1.11.12.13. They were compounded of the foure elements, but the earth doth predominate, or beare rule in the body; as ayre doth in the Soule: and euery thing is placed in that element which beares greate≈øt ≈øway in the body, or materiall ≈øub≈øtance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How were they created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>According to their kinds, yeelding ≈øeed; both the le≈ø≈øer and greater:</hi> the le≈ø≈øer, as gra≈ø≈øe, herbes flowers, &amp; ≈øhrubbes: the greater, fruitfull trees, and the re≈øt without fruit. All which the earth brought forth by the commandement of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3808:92"/>God; and as it is the mother and breeder of them: ≈øo is it the Nur≈øe and fo≈øter-mother of them ever after. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. The act of the ≈øoule in plants, is vegitation: and they haue as it were, a mouth to draw nouri≈øhment, and prepare it for the ≈øtomacke, and a kind of liuer and heart for concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this facultie to nouri≈øh, hath foure compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to waite on it. Fir≈øt, Attraction, the Spirits drawing a portion to euery part. Secondly, Retention, whereby the part keepes and holds what it hath gotten. Thirdly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, to dige≈øt and convert what it hath gotten into it ≈øelfe. Fourthly, Expul≈øion, whereby it reiecteth and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth what≈øoeuer is ≈øuperfluous. Now the ≈øeed is an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the la≈øt concoction, and therefore is from the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øimulation of the nouri≈øhment, which makes it like euery part. Hence from ≈øimular parts, it begets ≈øimular parts; and out of ≈øo little a part being full of Spirits, are begotten all other creatures. In ≈øeed and food con≈øi≈øts all vegitable life, and a hurt in either is dangerous, and often deadly. From nutrition proceed augmentation and generation; the one for exten≈øion of the ≈øame thing, the other, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of it in others. Extention is by heat, hence fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are le≈ø≈øe then males, becau≈øe their heat is le≈ø≈øe, though often they haue more moy≈øture. Generation, is by ≈øeed, which receiues from plants, and all other things, the ≈øoule and ≈øub≈øtance of euery part. Hence is it able to giue the kind that yeelds it. And therefore the Lord ≈øayes euery Plant yeelding ≈øeed after his kind. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12. Teaching vs thereby, that the ≈øeed vertually, and potentially, an≈øweres the creature in euery part and member of it?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When were the≈øe made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The ≈øame day wherein the waters and earth were created.</hi> Gen. 1.13. And ≈øo by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of an evening and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was there a third day, or 24. houres. In creation of the elements, God began in the top of the matter: but in the elementaries he began in the bottome, fir≈øt creating the Mineralls, and then the Plants. For God is a God of order and ≈øo pa≈ø≈øeth on in his worke from imperfection to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3808:92"/>I meane, where there is a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of parts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe God begins with the be≈øt fir≈øt. For the Lord did not in the vniver≈øe, as men doe in building, rake fir≈øt in the earth to lay the foundation, and adde the roofe la≈øt: but he fir≈øt laid on the roofe, and la≈øt of all came to the foundation. Fir≈øt heaven, then fire, next ayre, and la≈øt of all water and earth. Yet being the God of Art, followed an exact methode in all; for being come to the earth, hee fir≈øt makes things ≈øpring, then moue, after ≈øpring moue and walke by ≈øen≈øe. La≈øtly, as an Epitome of all the re≈øt he comes to man, which growes, moues, walkes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the re≈øt, liues by rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Creation of the lights?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he made them in the element of fire, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life to runne round, carrying the ≈øame ≈øide ≈øtill forward, that they may bring light vpon the earth, and ≈øeparate betweene day and night, and be for fignes and ≈øea≈øons, dayes and yeeres.</hi> Gen. 1.14.15. Iob 38.31.32.33. P≈øal. 8.2.4. P≈øal. 19.2.3.4.5.6.7. and 136.7.8.9. Ier. 31.35. Amos. 5.8. &amp;c. Fal≈øe and fabulous Phylo≈øophie makes this doctrine a wonder, and they that bring <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> laugh at this le≈ø≈øon. Starres to liue is again≈øt rea≈øon, for they are not nouri≈øhed, neither doe they increa≈øe or generate, &amp;c. I may reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon Divines from <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> by a probable argument they were created after liuing things, therefore they haue life, &amp;c. <hi>Ari≈øtotles</hi> obiection is ea≈øily an≈øwered. Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting in the moy≈øture of ayre is to be nouri≈øhed; not in the ≈øpirit of fire. Animall ≈øpirits if they were not generated of the vitall, and daily re≈øtored by them, they might liue by their fiery nature, as well as ≈øtarres. Let this then be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all elementarie ≈øoules, are either the formall ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the ayre, or fire: and then ≈øtarres hauing the one and not the other, may liue without nouri≈øhment. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Starres are as vitall as the animall ≈øpirits in man, and both comfort and beget life, &amp;c. Againe, their motion ≈øhewes they liue, for nothing is moued from place to place without it. If God and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> may be heard, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3808:93"/>≈øhall ea≈øily haue their mouthes ≈øtopped. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euery where te≈øtifieth of the motion of the Starres. Which mu≈øt either be by coun≈øell, or nature, or violence, or fortune. Not by coun≈øell, for their motion is regular, and alwayes the ≈øame, and this were ≈øufficient to proue the cau≈øe next vnder God to be naturall. But the opinion is, they are moued by the externall force of Angels, as a wheele by a dog, or a Crane by walking men. I reade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Angels are mini≈øtring ≈øpirits for the good of the elect; but no where in Gods booke, that they turne the wheeles of heaven. And againe, the light being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to good and bad, the good Angels ≈øhould mini≈øter daily, as well for reprobates as Gods elect. But to ≈øtill all cackling in this cau≈øe, let the Text cleare it ≈øelfe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.15.16.17.18. That which God ≈øaw to be good, an≈øwers Gods intention in his motion to his end. Therefore the Starres had ≈øo much by their creation, that they were able to devide, giue light, rule dayes and nights, the which they were vnable to doe without motion; God therefore gaue them a power to moue, that they might obtaine the≈øe ends; which if they ≈øhould a≈ø≈øume from any other then God, would argue the imperfection of his owne worke. It may well be thought they receiue this life in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as other things doe in the circumference. For being round, heat and ≈øpirit will mo≈øt vnite them≈øelues within, as in a ≈øilver ≈øpoone, turne the hollow ≈øide to the fire, and it will be very hot. But in plaine bodies heat is receiued in a cleane contrary fa≈øhion, as in <hi>Andyrons,</hi> where they be round, are very cold, but where they be plaine, they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot, and will burne ≈øoone. Starres therefore are round like globes, that heat may the better center in them, and make them the more actiue and liuely in their motion.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3808:93"/>which he cannot goe, and yet he comes out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, and in the ≈øtrength of his motiue ≈øpirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to runne his race; not tumble it as ≈øome dreame: for running a bre≈øt in the fire, hee pu≈øheth and ≈øhoueth it from him, that nothing can be hid from his heat &amp; light. His circuit is from one end of heaven to another, and by his quicke di≈øpatch, euery day either drawes a little nearer, or goes a little farther off: not that at any time he comes nearer the earth: but by fleeting a little his chambers, he comes ≈øometime in the yeere to dwell more directly over our heads then other. He devids night and day euery 24. houres with vs, and by running from one point to another the whole yeere. And it is as naturall to the Sunne to runne a circuit euery day, as another in a whole yeere: not that he is pulled contrary wayes by two diver≈øe orbes: but that which he doth euery day in part, that hee doth wholly and completely in a yeare. Now the part and the whole may agree in the ≈øame motion; and euery dayes race is but a part of the whole yeeres cour≈øe, which the Sunne may as truely keepe in the whole, as in the parts, and that without all contrary motions.

Bones are the ≈øu≈øtentacles of our bodies, and therefore would be painfull to vs, if they were tender of feeling. The ≈øinewes they are the organs and in≈øtruments, and carry in them the ≈øen≈øitiue ≈øpirits; and man is mo≈øt tickli≈øh where his skin is thinne≈øt. With the tips of the fingers, Phy≈øitians feele their patients, as being mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible of the pul≈øes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The tangible obiects are heat, cold, drought and moy≈øture principally: ≈øecondarily, the qualities that hence
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3808:94"/>ari≈øe. Ta≈øt is next, which is a kind of feeling, for both mu≈øt haue their obiects pre≈øent. Now it is made by the pa≈ø≈øing down of the ≈øen≈øitiue ≈øpirit from the brain to the tongue, &amp;c. Sight is made by conveiance of ≈øen≈øitiue ≈øpirits to the eyes, where they are met with the light without that fir≈øt comes to the watery humor, which is as lead to a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gla≈ø≈øe, that ≈øtayes the light, then it comes to the gla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie humor, and there is gathered together, then it comes to the cry≈øtaline, or cleare≈øt humor, and is carried vp vnto the braine, by the ≈øen≈øitiue ≈øpirit that meetes it. Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ≈øaies, that the≈øe ≈øen≈øitiue Spirits are a drie brightne≈ø≈øe, and that is, becau≈øe fire is here predominant, as wee may ≈øee by a blow vpon the eye, the Spirits redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, are made vi≈øible as fire. Tho≈øe that haue the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt eyes, as Catts, &amp;c. ≈øee better in darkene≈ø≈øe then other creatures, and wor≈øe in the light; becau≈øe the greater light darkens the le≈ø≈øer. Hearing is a fourth ≈øen≈øe, and meets with the noy≈øe in the eares, there it centers: for noy≈øe is made by a circle in the ayre, not much vnlike vnto that which wee ≈øee in the water when wee ca≈øt a ≈øtone into it. Hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe as many as ≈øtand within the circle or circumference of the ≈øound made in the ayre, heare it; and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe any point or center within the circle of the ≈øound, is potentially in euery part of it, &amp; one point is enough to bring it to our eares: yet we cannot ≈øee ≈øo; for, when we but looke at a thing that is round, wee cannot ≈øee it all at once. But I mu≈øt not play the Phylo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher too much; it is my de≈øire, that God for his workes may haue the due glory.

               <p>
                  <hi>Whereby he made them of a body and ≈øoule immortall.</hi> Gen. 1.26. Other creatures were made by a ≈øimple command; Man not without a divine con≈øultation: Others at once; Man he did fir≈øt forme, then in≈øpire: others in ≈øeverall ≈øhapes, like to none but them≈øelues; Man after his owne image: others with qualities fit for ≈øeruice; Man for domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. His bodie and ≈øoule are both immortall; for, death is an enemie. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. And therefore no con≈øequent of nature, but a companion of ≈øinne: yet this is true, that euery elementary is corruptible, and re≈øoluble; and ≈øo is the body of man, being taken out of the du≈øt: but as it was made a companion of an immortall ≈øoule, immediately made of nothing, ≈øo is it fit, that it ≈øhould be aboue its own nature elevated, to be one, though not <hi>per vim contactus,</hi> yet <hi>per vnionem per≈øonae,</hi> immortall and eternall. Almighty God after he had drawne the large, and reall map of the world, abridged it into this little table of Man, as <hi>Dioptron
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3808:96"/>Microco≈ømicum,</hi> which alone con≈øi≈øts of heaven and earth, ≈øoule and body. In his ≈øoule is the nature of Angels, though not ≈øo exten≈øiue and actiue, as wee may ≈øee in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and great man, &amp;c. In his bodie are the foure elements, the Meteors and Mineralls, as may appeare both by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and fumes, and ≈øpirits. He liues the life of a Plant, he hath the ≈øen≈øes of bea≈øts; and aboue all, the addition of rea≈øon. His body is more exqui≈øitely made then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as may appeare by the nakedne≈ø≈øe of it. For others that are clothed with feathers, and haires, &amp;c. ≈øhew that they are fuller of excrements. The Lord brought him vpon the ≈øtage fully prepared, that he might be both an actor and a ≈øpectator. He had a body, with hands for action, and an head for contemplation.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did God create him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In his owne likene≈ø≈øe and image.</hi> Gen. 1.26. Colo≈ø. 3.10. And it is ≈øo called, becau≈øe man was furni≈øhed in euery point, to re≈øemble the wi≈øedome, holine≈ø≈øe, and righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of God, not onely in this frame and perfection of body and ≈øoule, but al≈øo by his actions, and government of the creatures: and this was naturall vnto man. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts thinke, that this image was ≈øupernaturall; but vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øeeing it was of his created perfection, hauing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt excellencies of all things here below. For an image is a ≈øpeciall kinde of ≈øimilitude, and ≈øo man after a more ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ≈øort, then all other creatures, re≈øembles the maie≈øtie of his Creator, even (as it were) a ≈øtature, or image of him: yet mu≈øt we take heed of the error of the <hi>Authropomorphoi</hi> and Papi≈øts, who metamorphize God into the ≈øhape of a Man, old and auncient. For the likene≈ø≈øe ≈øtands not in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a body and ≈øoule, but in the hability of both to worke an≈øwerably to the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and holine≈ø≈øe of God. And image, be≈øide ≈øimilitude, which is the generall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines two things more, expre≈ø≈øion, and repre≈øentation. Fir≈øt it mu≈øt either be expre≈ø≈øed by another thing, or el≈øe exemplarily formed to ≈øuch a patterne and pattent, and as it were, the very copie and countenance of it. Hence one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3808:96"/>egge though it be the ≈øimilitude of another, yet is it not the image: and ≈øo one man is like another in ≈øhape, but not his image: yet is the ≈øonne the image of his father; and my face in a gla≈ø≈øe, the image of my naturall face: ≈øo is the ≈øtamp in bra≈ø≈øe, waxe, &amp;c. the image of the ≈øeale, and the picture of Cae≈øar, the image of Cae≈øar. Secondly, It mu≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent ≈øpecifically, either the ≈øub≈øtance, or accidents of the thing whereof it is an image. Hence the ≈øonne is the image of his father e≈ø≈øentially, and a picture mans image acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally: and by this it appeares, that an egge is not the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of an Hen, though it be expre≈ø≈øed by her, or a worme of a man, though it be engendered in, or out of his body. The image of God, by naturall expre≈ø≈øion and repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the onely ≈øonne of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He alone is of the father by nature, and e≈ø≈øentially, as it were, his very forme and figure, &amp;c. But man is an image by coun≈øell. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. And more ≈øpecially from God then other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let vs make,</hi> It was enough for other creatures to be, but man is not without ≈øpeciall coun≈øell, and in ≈øpeciall manner, is made a fit ≈øubiect for the three per≈øons to declare their workes in him. No doubt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Gho≈øt did even now con≈øult, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their eternall act, to produce man, as he might bee fitte≈øt to declare ≈øeverally the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and holine≈ø≈øe of each per≈øon. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. The new man is Chri≈øts the putting on of him is the Spirits, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him the Fathers. Surely, he that did loue his owne image without an obiect, did al≈øo loue it when he had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and was ≈øo carefull of it, that when man had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed it, he would haue it repaired againe by his Sonne; and his elect inve≈øted into it by his ≈øpirit. He that can loue without an obiect, can hate without an obiect, and yet hate nothing but the oppo≈øite of his owne image. His loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at him≈øelfe, as an affection of vnion, and ≈øo doth his hatred, as an affection of ≈øeparation. And God doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øeparate where he once loues. Hee condemnes euery ≈øinner: but the hatred of condemnation is not alwayes the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3808:97"/>hatred of ≈øeparation. It plea≈øeth God to loue him≈øelfe, and his owne image, and to loue it con≈øtantly in his owne Sonne: and who ≈øhall complaine, that he is ≈øeparated from this loue? Sinne makes a ≈øeparation in all, in regard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Farre be it from the iu≈øt Iudge, to favour either ≈øinne or ≈øinner: yet notwith≈øtanding the vnion of loue remaines ≈øtill; for either he loues his owne image in the elect, or the elect in the image of his ≈øonne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein con≈øi≈øts this image?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Either in conformation, or domination:</hi> fir≈øt he is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe Gods image in his conformitie with the holine≈ø≈øe and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of his Creator. Secondly, in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and rule over the creatures. As God is holy in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, righteous in his actions, and Lord in his commands: ≈øo man was made mo≈øt pure, and holy, filled with originall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, for all righteous actions, and made a pettie Lord, or Lord deputy over all the creatures. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein con≈øi≈øts his conformitie with God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Both in his body and ≈øoule;</hi> for that which executes is to be holy, as well as that which acts. 1. <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.13. <hi>and</hi> 12.1. The≈øe places ≈øhew plainely, that the body and members, being in≈øtruments of the ≈øoule are to be ≈øo tuned and touched, that there may be an excellent harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny betwixt the will of God, and the whole man. For wee are made of God both in body and ≈øoule, to glorifie God, in v≈øing all faculties and members, parts and powers, as in≈øtruments of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and true holine≈ø≈øe. 1. <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whereof, and how was the body made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Of the finer du≈øt of the earth, with the re≈øt of the elements;</hi> hence it was po≈ø≈øible for man to die: yet that it might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy health, and never ≈øicken the Lord made it of a mo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper, and by the v≈øe of whole≈øome food, and his ble≈ø≈øing therein to continue, and hold out; and thereupon it was po≈ø≈øible for man not to die. Be≈øides, the Lord furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed it with mo≈øt excellent in≈øtruments, ab≈øolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3808:97"/>both for beautie and dutie in all the workes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.25. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 8.5. &amp; 139.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. The matter of mans body, though ba≈øe≈øt, as earth, yet fine≈øt and pure≈øt, as the du≈øt. For as Moates in the Sunne are neare≈øt pure ayre; ≈øo is du≈øt neere≈øt their nature, being (as it were) the ≈øifting of the earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layed by water was red earth. Mans body then had the pure≈øt portion of earth. For the forme it was erect and ≈øtraight, and this was done, becau≈øe he was to ≈øpeake to others, as likewi≈øe to God, and therefore was not to looke vpon the ground, as if that ≈øhould haue beene his obiect, &amp;c. The body all over is vncovered, that it might be a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter habitation for the rea≈øonable ≈øoule, which is much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by abundance of excrements. In euery part, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ≈øtrength, convenience meete together. His head is round, and fuller of braines then any other creature, that it might be the throne and ≈øeat of rea≈øon: and becau≈øe his attendants are there, I meane the ≈øen≈øes, it can turne any wayes for rea≈øon to over-looke them. Within the braine are many cells, or cellars, for the Spirits to goe in, and as me≈ø≈øengers to be di≈øpatched vp and downe for rea≈øons v≈øe, which are not in other creatures. As he hath a head for contemplation, ≈øo hands for execution, differing from bea≈øts. Againe, all the internall parts are of more excellent matter and forme, then tho≈øe in bea≈øts. Hence mans braine makes finer ≈øpirits then theirs; his liner and heart finer bloud, and better concocted, and all for the exerci≈øe of the rea≈øonable ≈øoule. His head is neere≈øt heaven for place, figure, and ghe≈øts, there dwell the maie≈øticall powers of rea≈øon, which make him a man and not a bea≈øt. The ≈øen≈øes here take their originall, &amp; mo≈øt their in≈øtruments. There are the liuing gla≈ø≈øes placed in the mid≈øt of his vi≈øage, which bring obiects a farre off to the minde, and becau≈øe they are too tender opticke peeces, ≈ølie of the mo≈øt ≈øoft and lawny touches, they are mightily defended and fenced with hollow bones, and with prominent browes, and lips. And lea≈øt they ≈øhould be too much bent on what they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3808:98"/>ought not, they haue peculiar nerues to pull them vpward to God, as al≈øo to the ≈øeat of their re≈øt. What a tongue hath God giuen him, the in≈øtrument, not of ta≈øte onely, but of ≈øpeech al≈øo? How ≈øweet and excellent voyces are formed by that loo≈øe filme of fle≈øh? What an incredible ≈øtrength is giuen to the weake bones of the iawes? What a wonder of ≈øo few letters, to make infinite words, and giue them ≈øeverall ≈øounds, with a di≈øtinct articulation, and ready ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to the hearers? The cau≈øes whereof in nature are the≈øe. The lungs or lights breath to coole the heart, and like a paire of bellows, thru≈øt out that ayre which they haue receiued, and it goes and comes by the wind-pipe, which is made rough, as it were, with ringes to ≈øtay the breath it goe not out altogether, at the top thereof is a peece of fle≈øh to cover the mouth of it. Now in the pipe this noy≈øe comes vp, and lies in the almands, and makes a re≈øound, and is turned vpon the tongue, which ≈øtrikes it again≈øt the pallet and teeth, and makes an articulate ≈øound, cutting in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the whole ≈øound, either into a letter, or clapping di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe together, makes ≈øyllables, and ≈øo words, and then ≈øentences. This articulation is naturall, but the appellation of things by names is artificiall, and belonging to the Art of Grammar. In Babels bablers to ≈øtop their proud at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, God meddles neither with hands, nor feete, but their tongues, not pulling them out, or loo≈øing their ≈øtrings, or making them ≈øpeechle≈ø≈øe, but by teaching them to ≈øay too much. A ≈øound of letters befooles the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ≈øpoiles the worke. I beleeue this confu≈øion was made in turning of letters; when they intended to put ≈øuch letters together, God taught them to di≈øpo≈øe them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>ab, ba, &amp;c.</hi> And now poore creatures, how long doe wee ≈øtay vpon the ≈øhell of tongues, before wee come to chew the ≈øweet kernell of knowledge? Divi≈øion of tongues hinders any worke, and is often a cau≈øe why our <hi>Sion</hi> ri≈øeth no fa≈øter: and though it over-threw old Babel, yet doth it build the new. Onely I except the clouen and fiery tongues of the Apo≈øtles. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. The Spirit teaching
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3808:98"/>the Art of Grammar without meanes, &amp;c. Againe, that goodly proportion God ≈øet in the face, how is it altered with pa≈ø≈øion, as with ioy and ≈øorrow. Laughter ari≈øeth from the exten≈øion of the heart, which ≈øends ≈øpirits apace from it ≈øelfe, and becau≈øe they are hot, fly vpwards, and ≈øo come to the face that is very full of mu≈øcles, cold by nature and ≈øo contracted, yet by the heat comming thither, are extended, which is the laughter in the face. Onely this mu≈øt further be added, that the heat of the head and braine doth ≈øympathize with other parts of the body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apprehen≈øion of a ridiculous obiect ≈øends downe to the heart from the head, &amp; then back againe to the face. Teares ari≈øe cleane contrary, for the head being ≈øtricken with the apprehen≈øion of ≈øome ≈øorrowfull obiect, the heart is ≈ømitten too, and contracts it ≈øelfe, and ≈øo ≈øends vp tho≈øe chry≈øtaline humors that are to coole it, and are ≈øque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed out by contraction of parts, and ≈øo runne out at the eyes. The head ≈øtands vpon a comely, and tower-like necke, mo≈øt ≈øinewie, becau≈øe ≈ømalle≈øt. I might carry you downe to his feete, but my purpo≈øe is not to play the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi≈øt any further, then to giue a little ta≈øte of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke. All the inward ve≈ø≈øels for all offices of life, nouri≈øhment, ege≈øtion, generation, &amp;c. no veine, ≈øinew, artery, &amp;c. are idle. Yet this body compared to the ≈øoule, what is it, but as a clay-wall that encompa≈ø≈øeth a trea≈øure; as the wooden box of a Ieweller; or, as a cour≈øe ca≈øe to a rich in≈øtrument; or, as a maske to a beautifull face? let vs therefore come to his Soule.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How was the ≈øoule created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Immediately of nothing:</hi> hence it dies not. Man was made la≈øt, becau≈øe he was worthie≈øt. And the ≈øoule was la≈øt in≈øpired, becau≈øe more noble then all the re≈øt. And the in≈øpiration of it, is by creating to infu≈øe, and by infu≈øing to create. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1. The breath of life was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within, and not without man. And though it be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet is it of great value. A little peece of gold containes many peeces of ≈øilver; one Diamond is of more worth then
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3808:99"/>many Quarries of Stone; and one Load-≈øtone hath more vertue then mountaines of earth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How then was the ≈øoule indued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>With mo≈øt excellent faculties, which either worke vpon the body by Spirits, or them≈øelues by rea≈øon.</hi> As the ≈øoule works vpon the body by elementary ≈øpirits, it is po≈ø≈øible for man to die, but as the≈øe by the ble≈ø≈øing of God, are cheri≈øhed by whole≈øome food, man againe might not die. The≈øe ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are either naturall, as hauing ayre predominant in them, and they ≈øerue for generation, and augmentation, and nutrition, or animall, hauing fire predominant in them, and they ≈øerue for ≈øen≈øe, or motion; now the motiue faculties are either for locall motion, whereby the bodie is carried vp and downe; or epithumeticall and internall motion, whereby the ≈øoule is moued with de≈øires, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, e≈øpecially loue and hatred, which are the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of all others, whether they be in the concupi≈øcible, or ira≈øcible facultie: as ioy and ≈øorrow, in re≈øpect of pre≈øent obiects, hope and feare, in regard of ab≈øent, &amp;c. Be≈øide the≈øe ≈øeparable faculties, and not practi≈øed without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the ≈øoule hath more eminent and excellent powers and abilities, which it is able to v≈øe being ≈øeparated from the body, and they are rea≈øonable, whereby he might be the free beginner of his owne action, that is a cau≈øe by coun≈øell. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.10. and the≈øe faculties are vnder≈øtanding, and will. And thus you ≈øee how God hath giuen vs a Soule to informe our bodies, ≈øen≈øes to informe our ≈øoule, faculties to furni≈øh that ≈øoule, vnder≈øtanding, the great ≈øurveyer of the ≈øecrets of nature, and grace; by this man ≈øeeth what God hath done, by this he can admire his works, and adore him in what he ≈øeeth. Here is fancie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the ma≈øter of great workes; Memory, the great keeper, or ma≈øter of the Rolles of the Soule, a power that can make amends for the ≈øpeed of time, and make him leaue his Monuments and Chronicles behind him. There is will, the Lord-paramount, keeping ≈øtate in the Soule, commander of all actions; and the elector of all our re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3808:99"/>Iudgement ≈øits by as the great coun≈øellour of the will: affections follow as good ≈øervants of both. And for the good thereof, hath God giuen a body fit to execute his charge, ≈øo wonderfully di≈øpo≈øed, as that euery part hath be≈øt opportunitie to his owne functions; ≈øo qualified with health, ari≈øing from proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of humors that like a watch kept in good tune it goes right, &amp; is ≈øet to ≈øerue the ≈øoule, and maintaine it ≈øelfe. But alas, they are not now like the fir≈øt copie from which they were drawne, more like the ingrauings of Tombes, walked on with foule ≈øhooes, the very Characters of nature blotted out with originall ≈øin, and troden out with daily ≈øinnes. The Bookes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences are cla≈øped and ≈øealed vp, and the woefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are not read by the law, they remaine as letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the <hi>iuyce of Orenges,</hi> which are onely to be made legible by the fire of Gods wrath, <hi>when the ≈øecrets of all hearts ≈øhall be di≈øclo≈øed.</hi> Behold, we were not more like God in our knowledge, holine≈ø≈øe, and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, then we are now vnlike our ≈øelues in their lo≈ø≈øe. O God how may we pray≈øe our ≈øelues to our ≈øhame, for the better we were, we are the wor≈øe. What is it for the ≈øonnes of prodigall and tainted Aunce≈øtors, to tell of the Lands, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips which were once theirs, &amp; their fathers? Lord whet our de≈øires, that we may redeeme our lo≈ø≈øe in thy Sonne. The fault ≈øhall be ours, if this our very damage proue not beneficiall.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did God further deale with man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>He gaue him dominion over all his creatures.</hi> P≈øal. 8.6. <hi>Thou ha≈øt made him to haue dominion in the workes of thy hands; thou ha≈øt put all things vnder his feete.</hi> Gen. 1.26.28. A ≈øhame for him that was to ≈øubdue all things, to ≈øuffer him≈øelfe to be ≈øubdued by them, &amp; become a very lacquey to his vile affections, in doing homage to the three great Idols of the world, <hi>Profit, preferment,</hi> and <hi>plea≈øure.</hi> Nay, ≈øhould labour to ≈øubdue the Lord of his life to become his va≈ø≈øall. The Glutton makes God his Cator, his belly his God, and him≈øelfe the Gue≈øt. The la≈øcivious wanton,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3808:100"/>makes God his Pandar, and him≈øelfe the lover. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous worldling, would haue God his broker, and him≈øelfe the v≈øurer. The angry ≈øinner would haue God his hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or executioner, and him≈øelfe the Iudge. The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious inqui≈øitor can ≈øome-times make God and Religion his ≈øtale, but honour ≈øhall be his God. If times ≈øerue, the credit of the Go≈øpell ≈øhall be ≈øubordinate vnto his credit: and Chri≈øt ≈øhall be a ≈øtirrop to climbe to promotion, the word as a trumpet to blazon our owne commendation, and the Pulpit a ≈øtage, or ≈øhop to ≈øet to view and ≈øale, our owne good parts. Fie on ≈øuch ≈øervice, or Lord≈øhip as ≈øhall make God to ≈øerue with ≈øinne. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43.24. <hi>Amos.</hi> 2.13. And the meane≈øt ≈øervants thus ride on Hor≈øe-backe. Its fitter for the Savages of <hi>Calecut,</hi> to place Satan in the throne, and God on the foot-≈øtoole, then for a Chri≈øtian to aba≈øe him≈øelfe to the creatures, and the Creator to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe. Oh that the Sunne of peace, ≈øhould looke vpon the≈øe vncleane heapes, or giue light to this brood of darkene≈ø≈øe. They are rare hands &amp; hearts, that are free either from a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øions of bloud, or ≈øpots of filthine≈ø≈øe. What ba≈øe rule keepes man here below? Oh the want on exce≈ø≈øe, exce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiue pride, clo≈øe Athei≈øme, impudent prophanene≈ø≈øe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull oppre≈ø≈øion, over mercifull connivence to ≈øinne, greedie covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, loo≈øe prodigalitie, ≈øymoniacall ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, vnbridled luxurie, bea≈øtly drunkenne≈ø≈øe, bloody trechery, cunning fraud, ≈ølanderous detraction, envious vnderminings, ≈øecret Idolatries, hypocriticall fa≈øhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈ø≈øe, &amp;c.

But I forget my felfe, ≈øeeing my taske is to lay downe a rule, and not inveigh again≈øt the breach of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein con≈øi≈øts mans dominion over the creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In a mo≈øt free v≈øe of all things for the glory of God, his owne nece≈ø≈øitie, and lawfull plea≈øure:</hi> and that without all let, or hinderance of any of his actions; and therefore if hee offended in them, it was his owne fault. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29. with Chap. 3.11. Man could not content him≈øelfe in knowing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3808:100"/>God and all his creatures, his curio≈øitie is to know more then ever God made, evill of ≈øinne, and evill of death. How deare this le≈ø≈øon co≈øt vs, we know well enough, &amp; ≈ømart with knowing. We the ≈øonnes of <hi>Eue</hi> inherite her ≈øaucie appetite, and mi≈øcarry daily with the pre≈øumptuous affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of forbidden knowledge. Oh Lord teach me a ≈øober knowledge, and a contented ignorance: thou ha≈øt revealed more then I can know, enough to make me happie, Giue me againe the tenure of grace, that I may hold what I haue as well in the con≈øi≈øtory of con≈øcience, as at the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas, lea≈øt whiles I be a civill owner, I proue but a ≈øpirituall v≈øurper: make me once againe a ≈øpirituall owner, and then I ≈øhall not care if I die a civill begger.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Fir≈øt, Gods commandement for the procuration of meate from the Plants to him≈øelfe, and the bea≈øts, as likewi≈øe the dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of them.</hi> Gen. 1.29.30. and 2.15. That which was mans ≈øtore-hou≈øe, was al≈øo his work hou≈øe; his plea≈øure was his taske. Earth ≈øerued not onely to feed his ≈øen≈øes, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe his hands: happine≈ø≈øe never con≈øi≈øted in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Idlene≈ø≈øe neither gets, nor ≈øaues; for, wee doe ill whiles wee doe nothing, and loo≈øe whiles wee gaine not. Houres haue ever had wings, to flie vp to heaven, to the author of time, to carry newes of our v≈øage. <hi>Eue</hi> could not long keepe chat with the Serpent, but God had notice of it, and for ≈øuch idlene≈ø≈øe turnes her out of Paradi≈øe. God e≈øteemes much of our times (what ever our price be) and plagues the lo≈ø≈øe of a ≈øhort time, with revenge beyond all times. God giue me grace, to take it by the fore-top, that I may make that which is wild and fugitiue, tame and pliable to my purpo≈øes for heaven.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ≈øecondly may be gathered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The bringing of all creatures, which could conveniently be brought vnto him, as their Lord, to ≈øee how hee would name them.</hi> Gen. 2.19. All Arts were engraven vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet none but man could ≈øee them; for he receiued them both actiuely and pa≈ø≈øiuely; and therfore by Logicke
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3808:101"/>vnder≈øtood their natures, and by Grammar gaue them names. And ≈øo even in this ≈øhewed his dominion over them, in that he knew how to governe and order them all.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What in the third place may be ob≈øerved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he was like a Lord placed in the Garden of Eden, as in a ≈øtately Palace, planted of God Ea≈øtward, with excellent trees, and other plants, as well for plea≈øure as for profit; and watered with a plea≈øant river, devided into foure heades, which was to wa≈øh the Garden, not like Nilus</hi> that makes <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> fertile with invndation. For that is the raine water that falls a good way off, and comes tumbling from the hills, and carries with it the ≈øoyles of other grounds, by the fatne≈ø≈øe and mud whereof that land is made fruitfull: but this was to wa≈øh away filthine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øuperfluous fatne≈ø≈øe in ≈øo excellent a ≈øoyle, lea≈øt all ≈øhould turne blade, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing corne. This Garden was knowne in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> dayes, and by the de≈øcription may be knowne in ours. <hi>Plinie</hi> ≈øpeakes of a citie, called <hi>Cte≈øiphon,</hi> which lies betweene the river <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> Gen. 2.14. which is wonderfull fruitfull, and it lies as an Iland en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed by both. Al≈øo it is well knowne, that in <hi>Babylon,</hi> neere <hi>Tigris</hi> is a mo≈øt fertile place for feeding of Cattell, and the people are faine to keepe them vp in the night for feare of ≈øuffocation. Their corne they mow thri≈øe, and then receiue a twofold increa≈øe. The Garden of <hi>Adonis</hi> was in this countrey. And Scripture mentioneth. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 19.12. <hi>The children of Eden, which were in Thel-a≈øare.</hi> That is, the Gari≈øon Souldiers that were in a tower again≈øt the King of <hi>A≈ø≈øyria,</hi> for the defence of this fruitfull countrey. The Topographie ≈øhewes plainely, that here-abouts the Garden ≈øtood. <hi>Perath,</hi> or <hi>Euphrates</hi> is a knowne river, that devideth <hi>Syria</hi> from <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and <hi>Me≈øopotamia, &amp;c.</hi> And may be taken for the whole river, though it haue but the name of the fourth river, which is, as it were, the midle ≈øtreame of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> running betwixt the ≈øecond &amp; third river, of which nothing is ≈øayd more then the name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3808:101"/>it was be≈øt knowne to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did write. <hi>Pi≈øon</hi> the fir≈øt river may very well be that which <hi>Plinie</hi> calls <hi>Pa≈øi-tigris,</hi> or <hi>Pi≈øo-tigris.</hi> And in <hi>Plinie, Diglath,</hi> or <hi>Diglito,</hi> another arme, is the ≈øame with <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> both ≈øignifying the ≈øame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> an arrow for the ≈øwiftne≈ø≈øe of the water; and this is the ≈øame with <hi>Tigris,</hi> now called <hi>Tegil.</hi> So that by all this, it is mo≈øt probable, that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den did lie betwixt <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>Plinie</hi> writes, that (as it were) a fi≈øh-pond, or Mar≈øh, in compa≈ø≈øe about an Acre of ground, burnes continually, which may not without probability be thought to be≈øome remembrance of that flaming ≈øword, which turned euery way to keepe man from the tree of life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. God in iu≈øt judgement, turning the place into a≈øhes, &amp; a burning poole, as he afterwards did <hi>Sodome,</hi> another <hi>Eden</hi> of the world. By this appeares the folly of Papi≈øts, that thought this Garden was not drowned in the flood, and that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> liue in it, &amp;c. Oh happy man, if hee had but knowne his owne happine≈ø≈øe, when he fir≈øt opened his eyes, he ≈øaw haven aboue him, and a flouri≈øhing earth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and him≈øelfe placed in the very Paradi≈øe and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the world. But this is cleane wa≈øhed away, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turned in the iu≈øt judgement of God. Yet read the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent de≈øcription of it and let the lo≈ø≈øe of it provoke vs to ≈øeeke after a better. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why did God thus place man in a Garden?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That man being appointed of God, as Lord deputie vnder him, might there ≈øerue him more freely, keepe his Court, haue nece≈ø≈øary imployment, both in dre≈ø≈øing and keeping the Garden.</hi> Gen. 2.15. It was one of <hi>Adams</hi> faults, to ≈øuffer the ≈øerpent to come into it. Another, to forget his dutie to God; for, the very trees did not onely affoord him worke for his hands, but in≈øtruction for his heart. There he ≈øaw two Sacraments in the very mid≈øt of the re≈øt of the trees, grow before him as mo≈øt eminent teachers of him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. The greater ≈øhame to offend God, who had ≈øo hedged him in on all ≈øides, that by a word of his mouth he might haue
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3808:102"/>rebuked the Serpent, and by the lea≈øt ca≈øt of his eye beene confirmed in dutie and diligence. But ble≈ø≈øed be God that we haue a better tree of life before our eyes; not a tree for triall, but for confirmation of being happie, in de≈øpight of Satan, of which we may eate and liue.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Of what kinds was man created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Male, and female.</hi> Gen. 1.27. The Male immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for his body of the foure Elements. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. The female for her body of one of his ribs, man being ca≈øt into a deepe ≈øleepe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. Man had better loo≈øe a peece of him≈øelfe, then mi≈ø≈øe a good wife. Yet the Lord would not paine him in ≈øending him a meete helper; as for their Soules they were equally in≈øpired, that they might both be partakers of the ≈øame happine≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. For the image they were both equall.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why did God make her?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>God ≈øaw that it was not good for man to be alone, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the re≈øt of the creatures, there was none fit to be his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Gen. 2.18.20. That there might therefore be wanting to him no comfortable thing, God thought it needfull, that he ≈øhould haue ≈øuch an helper as might ≈øatisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires, and giue him by his divine benediction, a fruitfull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpring. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. All that man ≈øaw immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his creation, were fit to be his ≈øervants, none his companions; and the ≈øame God that found the want ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it. Rather then man ≈øhall want a comfort, God will begin a new creation, not out of the earth, mans fir≈øt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or out of other creatures, his ≈øervants: but out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe for dearne≈ø≈øe, for equalitie, and that neither of the head nor foote, but the ≈øide, ≈øhewing her place, which is to ≈øtand next to her husband, neither as his drudge in being ba≈øely governed, nor as his wanton in crowing over him. Furthermore, God con≈øults not with man to make him happie. As he was ignorant while him≈øelfe was made, ≈øo ≈øhall he not know while a ≈øecond ≈øelfe is made out of him. Both that the comfort might be greater then was expected, as al≈øo, that he might not vpbraid his wife with any great
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3808:102"/>dependance, or obligation, he neither willing the worke, nor ≈øuffering any paine to haue it done. The rib can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no more of her, then the earth can of him. They are both made equall debters to God, who alone tooke care, that they might both be happie in him, and by him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What did God with her being made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>He brought her to man, and ioyned her in marriage with him, who acknowledgeth her to be fle≈øh of his fle≈øh, and bone of his bone;</hi> This ≈øheweth how exqui≈øite knowledge he had from God. If God had giuen him her name, or the names of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, it had not beene ≈øo great a pray≈øe of <hi>Adams</hi> memory to recall them, as it was now of his judgement (at fir≈øt ≈øight) to impo≈øe them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Shee ≈øhall be called Woman, becau≈øe ≈øhe was taken out of Man.</hi> So piercing was the eye of his rea≈øon, that he ≈øaw the in≈øide of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at fir≈øt blu≈øh, and by his perfect knowledge, he fitted their names to their di≈øpo≈øitions; whereas we ≈øilly ≈øolves, his ignorant po≈øteritie, ≈øee but their skins ever ≈øince, and forget their very names, when we are told them. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he receiued her thankefully to be his wife, and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed that law of matrimony concerning co-habitation, <hi>Therefore ≈øhall man leaue his father and mother, and cleane to his wife, and they ≈øhall be one fle≈øh.</hi> Gen. 2.22.23.24.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How were man and woman perfect, whiles they were both naked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>They then needed no clothing, for yet there was nothing whereof they needed to be a≈øhamed, nor any externall thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be anoyed, which are the proper ends of apparell.</hi> viz. to hide our ≈øhame, and defend vs from externall danger of weather, and weakne≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When were they created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Together with the bea≈øts on the ≈øixt day.</hi> Gen. 1.31. Thus God leaues them to their con≈øcionable obedience, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to entaile a comfortable pro≈øperitie vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, and their ≈øeed after them, if their ≈øinnes ≈øtrip them not of all their hopes.</p>

               <p>Que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HItherto of the Creation; What is Gods Providence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An≈øwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is that part of Gods efficiencie, whereby he provideth for all his creatures, even to the lea≈øt circum≈øtance, that haue his being. P≈øal.</hi> 104.24. with 27. As he hath made them in excellent wi≈øedome, ≈øo in the ≈øame wi≈øedome he provides for them. Providence is not to over-≈øee, or ouer-looke his workes, but to worke, and haue an efficiencie in all things. Permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, to the creature, is not a ce≈ø≈øation to the Creator: but the Lord workes his owne will by euery permi≈ø≈øion. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is to minde the creature, God never forgetting the workes of his owne hands. Hence God may be ≈øaid to be the ≈øoule of the world, not informing it e≈ø≈øentially as a peece of any creature, but by his efficiencie in euery thing. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.29.30. <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.6.7. That which <hi>Mathew</hi> ≈øpeakes of the falling of a Sparrow, <hi>Luke</hi> interprets by not forgetting. In regard of Providence all things are done by rea≈øon, not of the creatures, for thereof they are ignorant, therefore by God. The falling of a Sparrow is a propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is made of arguments, which are cau≈øe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, all which is rea≈øon, not of the Sparrow, nor of men &amp; Angels, for they onely analy≈øe it, by ≈øeeing it done; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God alone who makes that rea≈øon to hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the very fall of a Sparrow, or hayre of our heads. And here come many errors to be touched. Fir≈øt, the error of nece≈ø≈øitie, which is, that all things fall out by a fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinie. There is a certaintie in all things; for, the coun≈øell of God is infallible, but no nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe; ≈øeeing the≈øe two in rea≈øon are oppo≈øed. Secondly, ≈øome goe as wide
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3808:103"/>on the other ≈øide, that would haue all things governed by fortune and chance: as if ignorance in vs, were to bee preferred before knowledge and coun≈øell in God A flocke of ≈øheepe ≈øtands not in more need of a Shep-herd, then the worke doth of God. Thirdly, others hold a Providence in the great and waightie affayres of the world, but none in the le≈ø≈øer, and ba≈øer workes. As if it were not as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for God to rule the lea≈øt, as to make them. A ≈øpire of gra≈ø≈øe was his creature, and it growes not but by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Fourthly, the Providence in Lots is not rightly vnder≈øtood, It is as ca≈øuall for a lot to fall, as an haire from the head: and yet the Providence is not equall; for, be≈øide the rea≈øon it hath from God in the cau≈øe and effect, ≈øo di≈øpo≈øed by him, It hath another in the conclu≈øion, that by ≈øuch a fall, ≈øuch a thing ≈øhall be determined, which is ≈øometimes miraculous, ≈øometimes ordinary, but alwayes the conclu≈øion of God. Seeing then both the rea≈øon in the propo≈øition and event is Gods, and not mans, it is ≈øoberly to be v≈øed, and not vpon euery ≈øleight occa≈øion. Chance may bev≈øed in recreation, for ca≈øualty is to vs in all things inevitable: but not determining chance, for that is at our libertie, and may follow our con≈øultation. A lot and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, differ as the generall, and ≈øpeciall; the generall is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to all our actions, and pa≈ø≈øing our rea≈øon, is ordered by God: the ≈øpeciall is incident to tho≈øe things which are warranted vs of God, when we take a ca≈øuall thing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it by Gods providence to determine ≈øome event. The fir≈øt is naturall, and ordered by that providence, which guides nature to his end, and ≈øometimes in wi≈øedome lets it mi≈ø≈øe his end, which is chance, falling be≈øide the ≈øcope of the ≈øecond mouer, though it hit with the fir≈øt. The other is divine, as being a te≈øtimony giuen by God, in the re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lome doubt. And here it may well be demanded, whether the Lot being a divine te≈øtimony, would like a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracle, ever conclude the ≈øame truth? I an≈øwere, the Lot is ever infallible in the conclu≈øion, becau≈øe the rea≈øon is Gods, and ought not to be iterated, for that makes God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3808:104"/>a lier; calling into que≈øtion, whether the Lot conclude by the Providence of God or no. Yet I ≈øay, in ≈øinnefull itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Lot is ordinary, and not extraordinary, that in the next fall of the Lot, fortune may change, and differ from the fir≈øt, &amp; yet the conclu≈øion in both be Gods, and that as his divine te≈øtimony. But you will ≈øay then Gods Oracle is vncertaine, and he may contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe. I an≈øwere. No. For they are both truthes, ≈øo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Providence of God, and the latter may bee a puni≈øhment of mans infidelitie, for di≈øtru≈øting God in the former. A lot is a cau≈øe by fortune, and therefore mu≈øt be referred to ≈øome cau≈øe by coun≈øell; not to men, for then might they make by the Lot what conclu≈øions they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; therefore to God, who by his owne coun≈øell makes ≈øuch a conclu≈øion in ≈øo ca≈øuall an accident. Furthermore, it followes not becau≈øe the matter of Lots is indifferent, that therefore it may indifferently be v≈øed in recreation; for, it is the forme &amp; the matter that giues the e≈øpeciall e≈ø≈øence. Things that are ≈øimply good, or ≈øimply evill, are not to be determined by Lots, for ≈øo may wee imbrace good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and evill for good. It mu≈øt be of a midle nature to both. Hence it is vnlawfull to choo≈øe two Magi≈øtrates by Lot, if both be not equally capable of the place; for ≈øo ≈øhall the Common-wealth be wronged by in≈øufficiencie. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this reproues them that exclude actiue providence from the workes of darkne≈ø≈øe; I know no providence which acts not, the Sunne can worke in a ≈øtinking puddle, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy dung-hill, and yet ≈øtill be pure. True it is, God permits things, when he doth not with≈øtand their actions: but to ≈øay he permits, not hauing any hand in the worke, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his providence, &amp;c. And here is excellent comfort to all Gods children, that their afflictions are not let loo≈øe at randum; but come from an Almightie power, guided by a mo≈øt wi≈øe providence, and tempered with a fatherly loue. This cannot but blunt the edge of all evils, to con≈øider that a divine hand is in them all. Savage creatures will be ≈ømitten by their keepers, when they are ready to teare
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3808:104"/>≈øtrangers in peeces: &amp; ≈øhall I ≈øtruggle with him that made and moderates the world, when he ≈øtrikes me? Either mu≈øt I blame the fir≈øt mouer, or di≈øcharge the meanes, though the men may be iu≈øtly blamed. I know the agent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever may be the fault of the in≈øtrument. The dying theefe pardons the executioner, and exclaimes on his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øt judge, or malicious accu≈øers. But I will neither be a foole, nor a rebell, either ignorant whence my cro≈ø≈øes come, or impatient, knowing them to be from my God. He hath ≈øtinted all my mi≈øeries, and weighed out euery dram of my ≈øorrowes, and the very powers of hell ≈øhall not be able to ca≈øt in one ≈øcruple more then he hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for me.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is Providence confidered in regard of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is ordinary,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary.</hi> God provides for his creatures, either by meanes, or by miracles. Wee plow, we ≈øow, reape, thre≈øh, grind, bake, &amp;c. God can skip over all the≈øe meanes, and multiply a few loaues to feed many thou≈øands. <hi>Math.</hi> 14.17. and make Corne grow without tillage. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 37.30. God hath leaue to leape the meanes, and whereas one bu≈øhell of Corne by ≈øowing may multiply ten, ten, twentie; twentie, an hundred, and an hundred, a thou≈øand, God can ≈øend all this at once, and multiply one loafe to as great a quantitie of bread, as may be made of a thou≈øand bu≈øhels. Sheepe, Wool, Wool-men, Spinners, Weavers, &amp;c. for the making of cloth, and cloth for gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God can doe all this at a leape, and giue cloth and ≈øhooes, &amp; make them la≈øt fortie yeares without all change. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. And giue them bread that did never come from the earth. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. He can make Sunne and Moone ≈øtand ≈øtill, cleare the eyes with clay, ≈øaue and helpe with many, few, or none. <hi>Io≈øh.</hi> 10.12.13. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.6. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. Hence wee learne that our extremities, are Gods be≈øt opportunities.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods ordinary Providence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he provideth by ordinary meanes.</hi> P≈øal. 147.8.9.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3808:105"/>
                  <hi>He covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the gra≈ø≈øe to grow vpon the mountaines: which giueth to bea≈øts their food, and to the young Ravens that cry.</hi> P≈øal. 104. ver≈ø. 10. to the end. Math. 6.26. Gen. 45.7. Act. 14.17. Lev. 26.26. Math. 4.4. And here comes to be detected the Devils ≈øophi≈øtrie, ca≈øt thy ≈øelfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon God, and v≈øe no meanes. And the Divinitie of the vulgar ≈øort, is to be learned in the beginning, and end of their ≈øalvation, negligent of the middle. Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and their finall e≈øtate, mu≈øt hang together without meanes; men would be ≈øaued by ≈øitting ≈øtill, and thinke it is enough, that they are either elected, or reiected. What is this but to eate the Corne out of the eare, nay, to fami≈øh, becau≈øe we will not abide the labour to grind, or to knead it; Sure I am, God is come to vs in a mo≈øt wonderfull manner; his Sonne is become as low as our ≈øelues, and though now returned whence he came, yet his word and ≈øpirit are ever pre≈øent, and there is nothing wanting, but a will to learne. Yet this ≈øhall be my conclu≈øion, that if meanes were wanting, I might looke for miracles. And faith can re≈øt vpon God, as all ≈øufficient in both.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods extraordinary Providence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he provideth extraordinarily, and by miracles:</hi> and that either again≈øt nature, or be≈øide nature, or aboue nature. As to cau≈øe the light de≈øcend without Starres. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4. To devide the red Sea. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21. To ≈øaue the three men in the hot fiery furnace. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. To devide <hi>Iordan. Io≈øh.</hi> 3.15. To in≈øpire the Apo≈øtles. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.11. Yea, the very making of lice, was Gods extraordinary fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.19. What el≈øe ≈øhould haue guided that vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vntaught teame, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12. in as right a path toward I≈ørael, as their teachers could haue gone, ≈øaue an hand aboue nature? What el≈øe ≈øhould over-rule brute creatures, to preferre a forced carriage vnto a naturall burden at home, ≈øaue a divine conduct? Little can wee, by the beginning of any action, gue≈ø≈øe a Gods intention in the conclu≈øion: yet by this may wee be premoni≈øhed to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3808:105"/>depend vpon him in all our affayres, and that with hope of good ≈øucce≈ø≈øes. Set faith a worke in any difficultie to make the motion, and wee ≈øhall be ≈øure to ≈øpeed, eyther the one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is a Miracle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is a worke aboue nature, and all ordinary meanes;</hi> as the rai≈øing of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Ioh. 11.43.44. It is for the mo≈øt part a vi≈øible ≈øigne, to manife≈øt the power of God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.4.5. <hi>and</hi> 15.31. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.30. And this is proper to God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.16. <hi>If this man were not of God, he could not doe ≈øuch Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein is the Providence of God ≈øeene?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the con≈øervation, and gubernation of all things.</hi> God made nothing pre≈øently to de≈øtroy it, but re≈øerues euery thing for further v≈øe of his glory and ≈øervice. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25. Two ≈øparrows, ≈øcarce worth a farthing, are pre≈øerved, and governed according to Gods will; yea, the very hayres of our heads are ordered by his providence. This mind, or forminding of the creatures, is, that their beings be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, and their actions governed. We ≈øtand not vpon our owne feete, for when God permits vs to goe alone, like children, wee get many knocks, and fall fowlly, becau≈øe we tru≈øt too much to the broken reede of our owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the con≈øervation of the Creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he keepeth and continueth the creatures in their being and kinds.</hi> Iob 12.14. P≈øal. 36.8.9. and 44.3. P≈øal. 104. and 105. and 106. and 147.10.11. If God de≈øtroy, none can deliver, and if he pre≈øerue, none can kill. It differs from government thus; that is, to guide to the end, this to keepe it for that end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. God kept <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his end.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein ≈øtands it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the pre≈øervation of their e≈ø≈øence, and forces, or faculties: and that both vniver≈øall and ≈øingular.</hi> P≈øal. 65.2. P≈øal. 104.27.28.29. and 136.25. and 147.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.26.30. It is God that keepes that cau≈øes and qualities in good temper,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3808:106"/>or changeth them from a bad condition to a good, and from a good to a better; or pre≈øerues them by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, one generation ≈øucceeding another; or keepes them in ≈øtate, as all the Starres which this day ≈øtand firme, as vpon the day of their Creation. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 65.6. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.4.5.6.7. Pre≈øervation is as the perpetuation of Gods creation, and as the continuation of it by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, or a permanent ≈øtation. <hi>Iob</hi> 10.8.9.10.11. <hi>and</hi> 31.15. The change and alteration of the creatures condition, is from God, whether it be good, or evill. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 76. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 5.6.7.9.12. <hi>and</hi> 104.29.30. <hi>and</hi> 107.34.35. <hi>and</hi> 113.7.8.9. Al≈øo their permanent ≈øtanding in their auncient e≈øtate, as Starres, Mountaines, Waters, and Earth, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 65.6.7. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.4. And all this extends it ≈øelfe, even to the lea≈øt of Gods creatures, ≈øparrowes, hayres, teares, and euery ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.30. <hi>and</hi> 10.29.30. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 56.8. <hi>and</hi> 68.20. <hi>and</hi> 113.6. <hi>and</hi> 146.8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.25. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 19.22. Now God pre≈øerues vniver≈øalls by generation and propagation, ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars by food and nouri≈øhment, &amp;c. As al≈øo by keeping them from violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is government?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he governeth all things to their end.</hi> P≈øal. 104.19. Pro. 16.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. God made all things for an end, he pre≈øerues them to it, and by government guides them in the way. All things are compo≈øed, betwixt a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and an ending, and God is both. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. As they are of him, ≈øo likewi≈øe without him would they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to nothing, he therefore pre≈øerues them, and becau≈øe they are for him, he guides and governes them all to the ends he hath appointed them. And yet this is done by ≈øeverall rules he giues them all. A man makes a Pen, and then writes with it, it may well be ≈øaid, that the Pen writes, and the maker writes: ≈øo, God made all, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them by his wi≈øedome, and the very Art of God ≈øtill remaining in his creatures, teacheth them all obedience to the hand that goes with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. Two <hi>common,</hi> and <hi>≈øpeciall:</hi> the one is as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law in a kingdome, the other, as the municipall, or priviledged lawes of Corporations.

               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he governeth all things by a common cour≈øe, or vniver≈øall law.</hi> P≈øal. 10.1.19. <hi>The Sunne knoweth his going downe.</hi> And here come in tho≈øe excellent in≈øtincts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein creatures ≈øhew the rea≈øon of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be more in God then them≈øelues.

               <p>Q. <hi>What it Gods ≈øpeciall government?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he governeth ≈øome ≈øpeciall creatures vnto an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall e≈øtate, as Angels and men.</hi> Prov. 16.4. Almightie God hath two ≈øorts of vertues, to manife≈øt in his creation and providence. Fir≈øt, intellectuall; Secondly, morall. No creatures but men and Angels are capable of the latter. The manifold works of God ≈øhew his excellent wi≈øedome, or the vertues of vnder≈øtanding. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.24. Onely men &amp; Angels can ≈øhew forth his Iu≈øtice &amp; Mercy, the vertues of his will. For this end he created them, and by a ≈øpeciall law governes them thereunto, and that which is done by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3808:107"/>law will iu≈øtifie it ≈øelfe again≈øt all exceptions. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How manifold was that eternall e≈øtate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two-fold; either of <hi>happine≈ø≈øe,</hi> or <hi>mi≈øery.</hi> Rom. 9.18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> Be a≈ø≈øured, the Lord will be as vnblameable in the one, as in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whence doth this felicitie, or infelicitie acrew to the rea≈øonable creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By the good plea≈øure, or di≈øplea≈øure of Almightie God.</hi> It was po≈ø≈øible for men and Angels to plea≈øe God, and be happy; and al≈øo po≈ø≈øible to di≈øplea≈øe him, and be mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And both the≈øe were to be acted by the law; for, it is the law that makes vs ble≈ø≈øed, or cur≈øed; and man might ≈øo handle the matter, that he might act whether part he plea≈øed, and yet his de≈øtruction come from him≈øelfe, though in life the law ≈øhould haue beene a principall agent. A che≈øt is made for linnen, or other clothes, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øtible: but the burning of it comes not from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Art, &amp;c. So man is mutable, and ≈øubiect to fall; yet his falling no wayes ari≈øeth from his Creator. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>and</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is here to be con≈øidered?</hi>

                  <hi>That fall of the Creature from the government of God, or his obedience therevnto, in ≈øo much that as now he ≈øtandeth, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plea≈øe God, but di≈øplea≈øe him continually.</hi> Gen. 3.6. <hi>and</hi> 6.5. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Marke where man fell, not in his con≈øervation, for his being and action are continued: but government, his action ≈øwarving from the line of Gods law, and it was nothing, but (as it were) the turning of the wheele the contrary way, ≈øo that now the whole man is exorbitant in his cour≈øes, and altogether oppo≈øite to his government: like <hi>Iobs wild A≈ø≈øe</hi> in the de≈øert, or as <hi>Amos</hi> his Hor≈øe that will runne vpon the rockes. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Of whom was this Apo≈øta≈øie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Of ≈øome Angels, and of all men in the fir≈øt man.</hi> Iud: ver. 6. Gen. 3.6. Rom. 3.10. Ioh. 8.44. angels and men were governed in their fir≈øt fall, God ≈øending the one to try the other. Man was to try the Angels, whether they would at Gods command mini≈øter for his good; and they againe man, whether he would li≈øten more to Gods law, or their rebellion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the things to be ob≈øerved in this Apo≈øta≈øie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The transgre≈ø≈øion and the propagation of it.</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>By one man ≈øinne entred into the world.</hi> Here is the head or ≈øpring, one man, the ≈øtreame or flood, ≈øinne, the channell, entred, the ≈øea or Ocean into which it fell, the world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.19.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The eating of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3808:108"/>good and evill.</hi> Gen. 2.17. which was a great offence, both in regard of God, his law, and Sacrament. He was bound to loue God aboue all; who gaue him the v≈øe of all trees, onely he forbids him this, even as he loued him not to eate thereof. Againe, the rule of good and evill was the whole law of mans life. And therefore here was not a partiall, but an vniver≈øall breach of all the branches of obedience. And la≈øtly, he in contempt of God, and his goodne≈ø≈øe, plucked off the ≈øeale of the covenant, for God placed that tree with the other in the very mid≈øt of the Garden, as a vi≈øible ≈øigne and Sacrament of his obedience. Man was changeably good, and therefore as he was to haue a Sacrament, to ≈øeale his con≈øtant e≈øtate in goodne≈ø≈øe, if he per≈øi≈øted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the loue of God, which was the tree of life: ≈øo, on the contrary, if he ≈øhould leaue off to ≈øerue God, then ≈øhould he haue ≈øealed vnto him the a≈ø≈øurance of his change from good to evill; and this was by the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill. Thus it plea≈øed God to deale with man, either in regard of obedience, or di≈øobedience. Ble≈ø≈øed be God, wee haue a better tree of life, to ≈øeale our perfect obedience in another: and two Sacraments to put vs out of all danger of death: God ≈øealing our ≈øalvation for his owne names ≈øake.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What things are to be ob≈øerved therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; <hi>The cau≈øes thereof, and the effects.</hi> Gen. 2.17. Ezek. 18.2. Rom. 6.23. Sinne and death are as in ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the cau≈øe, as fire and burning; death is a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequent of ≈øuch a cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many ≈øorts of cau≈øes be there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Two, the one, blameable and guiltie, the other, blamele≈ø≈øe and guiltle≈ø≈øe.</hi> The law and ≈øinne, as well s the law and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience worke together, though in a di≈øtinct manner; for, of obedience the law is the principall cau≈øe, but of ≈øinne an accidentall, as working be≈øide his owne ≈øcope and maine drift, which is to ≈øavour nothing but life, and al≈øo as a contrary to ≈øinne; hence a ≈øinner ≈øtands in violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to the law, and they ≈øtriue the more, becau≈øe the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3808:108"/>one is readie to hinder the others act; as bankes, or flood-gates ≈øtaying the ≈øtreame, make it either bur≈øt them downe, or el≈øe ≈øwell over them: and doe we not ≈øee how all ≈øuch as are bent vpon any villany, are more exa≈øpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by di≈ø≈øwa≈øion, then if they were let alone? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is better to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> whiles they willingly obey, then when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> come to preach their deliuerance; then as a bea≈øt he turnes madde with baiting. And ≈øo all the Martyrs ≈øhould haue had the Heathen Emperours better tutors then tyrants, if they had not provoked them by oppo≈øition of their wickedne≈ø≈øe. Nay, doe we not ≈øee how the be≈øt mindes, when they are troubled, yeeld incon≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate motions; as water that is violently ≈øtirred, ≈øends vp bubbles? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11.11.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many be the cau≈øes blameable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Two; The principall, and mini≈øteriall:</hi> the Devill a chiefe agent in mans apo≈øta≈øie, abu≈øed the Serpent, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as his in≈øtruments, to ≈øeduce man. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Satans policie was to take the ≈øubtill Serpent, and ≈øimple Woman, to defeat man of his happine≈ø≈øe, as now he doth the Ie≈øuites, and females, to draw men to Antichri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the principall cau≈øes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Devill, and Man:</hi> though <hi>Eue</hi> was fir≈øt in the motion, yet was <hi>Adam</hi> principall in the action; for he is fir≈øt called to the barre, to an≈øwere the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.14. Fir≈øt, he was the head of his wife, and therefore it was his ≈øinne, that he gaue her no better in≈øtruction. Secondly, the Covenant of life was made principally with him, and therefore it is ≈øaid, that when he had eaten, both their eyes were open. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. She did eate before her husband, and ≈øinned per≈øonally: but when he did eate with her, then they both ≈øaw, that they, and all their po≈øteritie were accur≈øed. Thirdly, It is probable, that <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øtood by all the time of the di≈øputation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ≈øinne was the greater, that he rebuked not the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and re≈øcued his wife from all ≈øuch ≈øugge≈øtions: or if he was ab≈øent, (whereof the Text makes no mention)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3808:109"/>then ≈øhould he ≈øhew him≈øelfe a weaker ve≈ø≈øell then his wife, who had all the bad Angels (in one craftie bea≈øt) to ≈øet vpon her: whereas he had onely one weake woman in his pure≈øt integritie to overthrow him. Neither could his affection then to his wife be ≈øo prepo≈øterous, as are now of corrupt naturali≈øts, who are blinded in loue. His loue to his wife was created pure, and therefore except his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had beene fir≈øt perverted, as it was in his wife, he could not ≈øo ea≈øily haue con≈øented, of meere affection to his wife. I cannot beleeue, but that the Devils in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, did as well tempt <hi>Adam</hi> as <hi>Eue,</hi> though fir≈øt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with her, as a further meanes of inticing him. The text ≈øayes not, that <hi>Eue</hi> went to ≈øeeke her husband; but that ≈øhee tooke, and gaue to her husband with her, &amp;c. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How were the Devils the cau≈øe of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>They were by creation good, and appointed of God to be mans keepers, yet of their owne accord, and free will they di≈ødained and contemned their ≈øtanding with God.</hi> Iud. ver. 6. <hi>and became proud, rebellious, and abominable lyers, and bla≈øphemers of God, and of malice and hatred of man, became ≈øeducers and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of him.</hi> Ioh. 4.44. It may well be di≈øputed, whether the Angels were Apo≈øtataes in heaven, or Paradi≈øe. If I may ≈øhew my iudgement, and leaue it as a probable opinion, it is this. The third heaven is a place of puritie, and ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute felicitie, and therfore cannot for a moment, or in≈øtant of time, be the ≈øubiect of any pollution, or mi≈øery. If ≈øinne had ever beene in heaven, the place ≈øhould haue beene polluted by it. The very earth was ≈øtained with the ≈øinne of his proper inhabitant: and ≈øo ≈øhould heaven, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar inhabitants had there ≈øinned: but ≈øuch was the wi≈øe providence of Almightie God, that at once he would giue a iu≈øt occa≈øion of triall, of the Angels in their obedience, and ≈øaue heaven from all polution, which he then, and now, and ever pre≈øerues mo≈øt pure for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, both Angels and men. The occa≈øion was giuen in their mini≈øtration to man, not the celebration of Gods
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3808:109"/>glory in heauen, that they might ≈øee more fitting their place then the other: but ≈øhall wee the mo≈øt excellent of Gods creatures, ≈øtoop ≈øo low as to become mans ≈øervants, and ≈øubiect our ≈øelues to ourinferiours, &amp;c? Let vs thinke of a cour≈øe to ≈øubvert his e≈øtate, and bring him out of grace and favour with his creator; ≈øo ≈øhall we according to our excellencie, Lord it over him. So that here might very well be a conioyned Apo≈øta≈øie in the ruine of them both. O ble≈ø≈øed God, how farre is thy decree from all ≈øtaine of ≈øin, and yet how full of Mercy and Iu≈øtice? Thou would≈øt not try all thy Angels, ≈øome thou kept≈øt at home, whiles others fell in mini≈øtring abroad. And all this, that thy ≈øonne might be exalted, neither Angel or man ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing without him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6.7. They that fight vnder this head; are all ≈øaued; if they warre vnder their owne power they cannot but peri≈øh. The good angels were but lookers on till a Me≈ø≈øias was promi≈øed, and then are they all mini≈øtering ≈øpirits for the good of their fellow heires of ≈øalvation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Who can ≈øay blacke is the eye of Gods providence, intending to glorifie his Iu≈øtice in the condemnation of ≈øome Angels, and ≈øome men, when he might haue executed all? Let vs all ≈øing with the ≈øweet Singer of <hi>I≈ørael.</hi> P≈øal. 119.137. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and vpright are thy iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How was man a cau≈øe thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By the abu≈øe of Gods law, and his owne free will, being ≈øeduced by Satan, and induced into ≈øinne by the ≈øtrength of his temptation, ≈øubtiltie of his ≈øugge≈øtion, and is owne free recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both, voluntarily harkning thereunto, contrary to Gods commandement, when being a≈ø≈øi≈øted thereby, he might ea≈øily haue re≈øi≈øted the ≈øame.</hi> Gen. 3.6. Man was made a mo≈øt free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of his owne action, neither did God withdraw, or with-hold any nece≈ø≈øary grace from him; he gaue him ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient not to ≈øinne, neither was he bound to giue him ≈øo much as he might prevent, and prevaile over euery violent temptation god might haue kept Satan from him, or in the combat haue giuen him the conque≈øt: but it was Gods
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3808:110"/>meaning to try him with the grace of his Creation: that now he may ≈øee the greater loue of his Creator, in putting him vnder a ≈øecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who prevailed again≈øt Satan, and in whom all the elect ≈øhall be ≈øure of victory. Hence learne, that ≈øince the fall, in the hardning of Reprobates, as in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God neither withdrawes grace, for he had none; nor with-holds it, for he is not bound to giue it: Chri≈øt is onely a head and fountaine of ≈øauing grace, for his elect Angels and men.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What were the in≈øtrumentall cau≈øes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Serpent, and the Woman.</hi> Gen. 3.1. The Devill to further his temptation, v≈øed vi≈øible in≈øtruments, and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ≈øubtiltie of the one, and ≈øimplicitie of the other, the woefull down fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his po≈øteritie. All the Legions of the reprobate Devils entred into one bea≈øt, to conferre with the woman, and by the <hi>Poitho</hi> and <hi>Suada</hi> of that viperous tongue, crept into the bo≈øome of <hi>Eue,</hi> as it were, by all the topicke places in Logicke, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Rethoricke, and other engines of guile &amp; deceit, till they had brought her into a fooles Paradi≈øe, with the lo≈ø≈øe of the earthly, and hazzard of the heauenly.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the vnblameable cau≈øe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The commandement of God, for had there beene no law there had beene no tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion.</hi> Rom. 7.7. Gal. 3.22. And here comes in the act of Gods providence in the apo≈øta≈øie of Angels and men. A law is giuen, by which God will haue them both ruled, but of this they make no account; for it is the very fir≈øt thing they begin to conte≈øt withall, and at length by plaine deniall oppo≈øeit. The law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to moue man to his dutie, even as that Spirit in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> moued the wheeles. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.21. The law was ≈øpirituall. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. And placed in the very heart of man, and was of a divine nature, to haue drawne man to good; but the ≈øpirit of Satan enters to graple with the law, and turne the wheele of the minde in a cleane contrary cour≈øe to Gods will: the law re≈øi≈øts, but man for≈øakes his mouer, and is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3808:110"/>turned of Satan the bie way; and ≈øo the good law of God <hi>becomes the ≈øavour of death vnto death.</hi> 2. Cor. 2.16. And that by an oppo≈øite motion to his owne nature. The tree was a ≈øeale, both of good and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>, and the fruit ta≈øted could leaue a tang of death behind it. The law was as able to guide to death, as life; to life by his free motion, to death by his oppo≈øition. He that runnes again≈øt a wall, or a tree, is throwne backe againe by violence, and brui≈øed in peeces by his ownefall and folly: or by this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon may you ≈øee the worke of the law, by ca≈øting Angels and men into hell. An earthen pitcher is da≈øhed by a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh and furious hand again≈øt an hard ≈øtone wall: that the wall breaketh it, is not the fault of the wall, but rather a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; all the evill is in the ha≈øtie hand that ra≈øhly hurles it again≈øt ≈øo apparent a death and danger: ≈øo wilfull and witle≈ø≈øe man by the ≈øugge≈øtion of Satan in the ≈øerpent and woman, takes him≈øelfe, and of his owne free accord flings, or rather flies in the very face of the law, and by it is mi≈øerably ≈øtricken in peeces Doe we not now ≈øee how the law makes him ≈øhiver and ≈øhake, even as a vanqui≈øhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnder the hands of his Conquerour, and how he ≈øeeks to ea≈øe him≈øelfe of ≈øuch a governour? He might as well haue knocked his head again≈øt the ≈øtone-walles, as his wits to fru≈øtrate the power of the law within him. A ≈øilly ≈øhift to ≈øtop a little torrent with ≈øodds and turfs, will it not breake over with roaring? A fooli≈øh fancy to ≈øtanch blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by ≈øtopping our no≈øthrils, will it not breake out at the mouth, or runne downe the throat into the ≈øtomacke? A man may with many piles of greene wood ≈ømoother and ≈øuffocate the fire for a ≈øea≈øon, but when the moy≈øture is ma≈øtered, the fury of the burning will be more fearefull, and the flames and fla≈øhes, more dreadfull to behold. Alas, alas, how doth euery ≈øinner pile vp the fagots of his future fire, and warme the worme in his owne bo≈øome, that ≈øhall gnaw for ever? Con≈øcience ≈øhall reade him a lecture euery day, becau≈øe he would not heare the lecture of the law for his eternall good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10.11.12.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That as the law was the cau≈øe of ≈øinne by accident, ≈øo was God, and no otherwi≈øe.</hi> Here was no omnipotencie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine man to fulfill the will of his creator; here was a law to re≈øtraine him from ≈øinne, and di≈øtre≈ø≈øe him in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, yea, and thru≈øt him head-long into all out-rage, being once oppo≈øed by man. Let men rot in their ≈øinnes, and they will die quietly: but ≈øtirre them by the liuely word, and ≈øinne will reviue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. and either kill wor≈øe by impenitencie, or be more happily killed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Mud in a gla≈ø≈øe, when it is ≈øhaken, runnes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that which before ≈øeemed pure and cry≈øtall. The poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the ≈ønake, whiles he is benummed with cold beareth no danger, but warme him, and he will hi≈ø≈øe and ≈øting. The Sea in calme weather is as ≈øtill and quiet as any river; but let the windes once blow and blu≈øter, and you ≈øhall ≈øee nothing but raging, ≈øtorming, and foaming out mire and dirt. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.1. <hi>When I would haue healed I≈ørael; namely by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions</hi> and rebukes of the word, <hi>then the iniquitie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was di≈øcovered, &amp;c.</hi> The law had an intent to ≈øaue man; but man would not hearken thereunto, ≈øo that his perdition was of him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ≈øecondly may be learned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God was no bare permitting, or for≈øaking cau≈øe, but a working cau≈øe, even in the fall of man.</hi> Gen. 3.1. It is Satans fir≈øt on-≈øet, <hi>hath God ≈øaid ye ≈øhall not eate, &amp;c.</hi> Like an eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig did he wrigle in by ≈øophi≈øticating the holy law of God; for he knew well enough he could not get in except he did driue that out, which was not done, but by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wre≈øtling, and wreathing on both ≈øides. And Gods worke was fir≈øt to hold out Satan, then in contempt to thru≈øt man vpon his adver≈øary, when he left him to cleaue vnto a lyer. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>They that de≈øpi≈øe me ≈øhall be lightly e≈øteemed.</hi> God in an holy indignation might well reiect them that had ≈øo ≈øhamefully reiected him; and (as it were) even pu≈øh man vpon the pikes of his owne puni≈øhment. It was no ioy to God, to ≈øee his beloued creature, ≈øo vilely
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3808:111"/>to ca≈øt away him≈øelfe; and yet God intended, &amp; wrought it without all blame, not as an author, or fautour of mans finne, but as a judge, ca≈øting him in his owne act, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king revenge vpon him for his ≈øinne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What will follow in the third place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>How God wrought in mans fall, yea, and from all eternitie, for Gods act began before mans.</hi> And this is ≈øafely to be done by our anatomie, or re≈øolution of Gods compo≈øition in this worke. Fir≈øt, God did it by his law, and ≈øpeciall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of man. Secondly, as he did it, ≈øo had he power to doe it, and ≈øuch a power, as neither Devils nor men are able to re≈øi≈øt. Man might re≈øi≈øt the law. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. but not the power, by which the law worketh; for man, not the law, ≈øhall ≈øuffer for the irruption, and breach of it. The law will be ≈øure, one way, or another, to make his part good, with the mo≈øt ma≈øterle≈ø≈øe mon≈øters. Thirdly, as God did it, and could doe it, ≈øo he decreed it to be done, and omnipotencie and efficiencie, are but two executours, no compo≈øors of Gods decree, and therefore it ≈øhall ≈øtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in the greate≈øt contingencie. It was po≈ø≈øible for man to fall, or not to fall, and his act was contingent, ≈øo true that it might haue beene fal≈øe, yet the decree was as certaine before as after the event, ≈øeeing all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to God, when they are ab≈øent to vs. Fourthly, as he decreed it, ≈øo it was done by coun≈øell. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.11. both in the ≈øcope, and plot. God had an end in mans fall, neitheir was it otherwi≈øe executed then him≈øelfe had plotted it. The Devils, and our fir≈øt parents, together with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, time, and place, could never haue ≈øo met together, except God had ≈øet it downe, ≈øo will I haue it acted, even to euery circum≈øtance. Fiftly, It ≈øeemed good to his wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ≈øo to haue it done, and no otherwi≈øe. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deales wi≈øely by ≈øinning. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10. but God is wi≈øe in decreeing how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ≈øhall ≈øinne. Sixtly, that which is done by the wi≈øedome of God, is good and iu≈øt. Hence ≈øinne, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to all good, and the enemie of iu≈øtice, was both good &amp; iu≈øt, not in it ≈øelfe, but as God decreed it to be a meanes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3808:112"/>of his glory, which it is not by his owne nature, for God is cli≈øhonoured by it: but by accident, as God <hi>can bring light out of darkene≈ø≈øe, good out of evill, and life out of death.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God did it, it was no ≈øinne, euery cau≈øe is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by his manner of working. Man ≈øinnes by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell, and God by coun≈øell orders it ≈øo to be done, and in doing workes as much as he willed. La≈øtly, as it was good and iu≈øt, ≈øo God willed it, but as ≈øimply evill, he willed it not, but did hate the being of it. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 5.4. Will is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øtep we mu≈øt ≈øtand vpon, and thus may we goe downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the ≈øame ≈øtaires we came vp. God did will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which was good and iu≈øt, and ≈øo it ≈øeemed good to his wi≈øedome, by coun≈øell to decree it, and by his power to effect it.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the guilt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby they are tyed to vnder goe the puni≈øhment.</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eate≈øt thereof, thou ≈øhalt die the death.</hi> Blame re≈øpecteth vice, as pray≈øe vertue; and guilt iu≈øtice, as libertie mercie. By the fir≈øt, ≈øinne is evill, and naught, by the ≈øecond, a debt. Wee properly owe nothing to God but loue and dutie: yet by forfaiture for non payment of the principall, we runne into further arrerages with God; and ≈øo are bound to a double di≈øcharge: fir≈øt, of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, ≈øecondly, of the forfaiture. It is a ≈øtrange opinion to thinke, if wee ≈øatisfie for the forfaiture, wee are freed from the principall. The law is ≈øtill in force, and except Chri≈øt pay both for vs, we ≈øhall never come by a full di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. He ≈øuffered to ≈øatisfie the forfaiture, and obeyed to pay for the principall. Our debts are now growne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and onely he that is infinite can di≈øcharge them. We might of our ≈øelues haue payed the principal: but now like Bank-rupts, we haue for ever di≈ø inabled our ≈øelues, and are not able to pay a penie in the pound, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea≈øe. God hath a bill, a bond, or a booke, wherein all our debts ≈øtand to be ≈øeene, and mu≈øt remaine vncancelled, and vncro≈øt, till all be payed. O good God, draw the red lines of thy Chri≈øts-Cro≈ø≈øe, yea, and the white lines too of his mo≈øt holy life, over the blacke lines, yea, the be≈øt lines of thine owne debt booke. Thou ≈øee≈øt better then our owne con≈øciences, euery peccant act of ours, in thought, word, or deed, oh let all our billes, and Items in thy booke be cleared, cro≈ø≈øed, and cancelled, by the precious bloud of thine owne ≈øonne, and our Saviour and ≈øuretie. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to expunge, cover, nullifie, aboli≈øh, &amp; wholly to take away the guilt of our defilement, and the gall of our puni≈øhment. In him wee know that thou our Creator wilt pardon all our ≈øinnes, &amp; debts, bearing action again≈øt vs, or obliging vs to any penaltie. Yet not euery hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3808:113"/>or profligate profe≈ø≈øor that liues as he li≈øt, mu≈øt looke for this loue.

               <p>Q. <hi>What then is the puni≈øhment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The iu≈øt anger of God vpon all that ≈øinne.</hi> Rom. 2.5.8.9. Heb. 10.31. with Chap. 11.29. I≈øa. 33.14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What Attributes doe here put forth them≈øelues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His holine≈ø≈øe, and that both in his Iu≈øtice and Mercie.</hi> Rom. 2.4.5. It ≈øhall well appeare, that God will not winke at ≈øinne, or giue vnto it the lea≈øt allowance. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 20.42. <hi>Ahabs</hi> life is to goe for <hi>Benadabs;</hi> this is but a ≈øhadow of Gods holine≈ø≈øe. If men mu≈øt wa≈øh away bloud with bloud; then a≈ø≈øuredly, God will wa≈øh his hands in innocencie, and by puni≈øhing of ≈øinne, free him≈øelfe from the ≈ølaine of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Gods holine≈ø≈øe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby being pure from ≈øinne in him≈øelfe, he cannot away with it in his creatures.</hi> P≈øal. 5.4. I≈øa. 6.3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his Iu≈øtice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby being mo≈øt iu≈øt in him≈øelfe, he cannot but execute iu≈øtice, as in well doing to them that doe well: ≈øo in afflicting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment on them that doe evill. As pray≈øe and price to the one, ≈øo all woe and want to the other.</hi> Rom. 2.6.7.8.9.10. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 20.5.6. The iu≈øtice of God, as it ≈øeemes to burne more remi≈ø≈øely again≈øt ≈øinne is called <hi>anger,</hi> as more ≈øharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>wrath;</hi> furthermore, as it ≈øentenceth, <hi>iudgement,</hi> and as it executeth the ≈øame, <hi>revenge.</hi> This holine≈ø≈øe and ju≈øtice were in God from all eternitie, yet till now no matter of manife≈øting them. They inquire after iniquitie, and take
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3808:113"/>hold of ≈øinne, and burne again≈øt it: yet with wonderfull moderation; fir≈øt, God ≈øeemes but to be angry, and (as it were) chids with the ≈øinner: then he growes into iu≈øt rage and ≈øtrikes the ≈øinner. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. After rebuke, followes correction, and whom words will not reclaime, wounds mu≈øt weary, and if gentler cha≈øti≈øements will not worke then by ≈øeveritie and extremitie, he breakes in peeces the ≈øinner. He can cha≈øti≈øe them with <hi>Scorpions,</hi> that will not be moued with <hi>whips.</hi> 1. Kin. 12.11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his mercie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he v≈øeth compa≈ø≈øion al≈øo towards his creatures offending.</hi> Gen. 6.3. and 8.21. P≈øal. 78.38.39. Mercie is more common then grace, for he pitties all, though he but receiue ≈øome againe into favour. He feeds the filthy as well as the faithfull with his hid trea≈øures; and makes his ≈øunne to ≈øhine, and his raine to fall vpon the iu≈øt and vniu≈øt. He vouch≈øafeth them (ill de≈øerving) common mercies, that they might ≈øeeke to him for more ≈øpeciall graces. Thus mercie is offered before the ≈øentence be executed, &amp; then iu≈øtice, which was all this time burning, flames out vpon ≈øinners that would not come at his call.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How manifold is this mercie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His clemencie and bountie:</hi> God is both gentle and kind to all ≈øinners, mild in mercie, and bountifull in his benefits. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 55.7.8.9.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his gentlene≈ø≈øe, or clemencie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby in iu≈øtice he remembreth mercie, kindly inviting ≈øinners to repentance.</hi> Ezek. 18.23. and 33.11. P≈øal. 103.8.9. <hi>The Lord will heare the cry of the poore, becau≈øe he is gracious, or kind.</hi> Exod. 22.27.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein doth it appeare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In his patience, and long ≈øufferance.</hi> He beares the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches of ≈øinners, and a while ≈øtayes and waites for their repentance. <hi>Erech appajim</hi> in Hebrew is one that hath a long no≈øe; and it is frequently giuen to God, for his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and longanimitie.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby in bearing he expecteth a long time for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> I≈øa. 55.7. &amp; 65.2. Law. 3.22. Eccl. 8.11. Ioel 2.12.13. 1 Pet. 3.9.15. God doth waite, and put out the hand for to receiue ≈øinners: yet let vs beware, for he that doth alwayes giue pardon to repenters, will not ever giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to the ≈øinner, <hi>at what time ≈øoeuer a ≈øinner repents, he ≈øhall find mercy;</hi> but if once the long ≈øufferance of God be over, wee cry too late. Ere vengeance begin, repentance is ≈øea≈øonable; but if judgement be once gone out, there is no hope of pardon. While the Go≈øpell ≈øollicites vs, the doores of the Arke are open; if wee neglect the time of grace, in vaine ≈øhall we ≈øeeke it with teares; God holds it no mercy to pittie the ob≈øtinate. He gaue an hundreth and twentie yeares re≈øpite of repenting before the deluge, and if the old world had not beene wilfull, it ≈øhould never haue beene ≈øo wa≈øted with waues and waters. How loath is he to ≈øtrike, that threats ≈øo long? Surely, he that giues ≈øo long warnings, de≈øires to be prevented. Swine fore-≈øeeing a ≈øtorme, runne home crying for ≈øhelter.

               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he being rich in mercie powreth forth his good gifts vpon his ≈øinfull creatures, notwith≈øtanding they offend him.</hi> Math. 5.45. <hi>Adam</hi> after he was fallen, had diver≈øe houres to bethinke him≈øelfe of his mi≈øery, for God came late vnto him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8.

God did analy≈øe and anatomi≈øe the ≈øinne backward wayes, an≈øt ≈øo finds out the principall agent, and beginnes with him. God could fir≈øt haue begun with Satan: but he ≈øhewes vs the way of the invention of euery crime, and craft, yea, and of euery worke done: and that is to a≈øcend vpward from the lowe≈øt and la≈øt agent, or his act. By man he found out the woman, and by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Serpent; and there he begins to cur≈øe, and puni≈øh. And vnder the Serpent are the Devils puni≈øhed. The Serpent was cur≈øed aboue all Cattell, and the Devill aboue all creatures. God put enmitie betweene the Serpent, and the Woman, and it is the greate≈øt; for, as a woman is more afraid of a Serpent then a man, ≈øo is a Serpent more afraid of a woman then a man: Phy≈øo≈øophers ≈øay, from the breath, or ≈øent of a woman, which is poy≈øonous to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: but Divines ≈øay, it ari≈øeth from this auncient enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is greater, then with any other creature. So the Devils, which were ≈øo familiar with a woman at the fir≈øt, ≈øhall by a woman receiue the greate≈øt overthrow. And we ≈øee the woman is more afraid of a Devill then a man; and the Devill is more afraid of a devout and godly woman, then a man; who recompence their ≈øin, with louing mo≈øt, and over-goe men in holy affections. And here I cannot but wonder, that women being nought, are mo≈øt familiar with the Devill, as we ≈øee by Witches, yea, and often vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øhape of a Serpent, or Worme: but this ≈øtayes me, that though the Antipathie be great, yet in ≈øinnes they come neare≈øt together, as in ob≈øtinacie and wilfull pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the puni≈øhment inflicted vpon the Devils?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are to learne it from their In≈øtrument; <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:3808:115"/>elegantly contriuing them vnder one head. Fir≈øt, then we haue the <hi>contu≈øion,</hi> or cru≈øhing of their heads, that is, the <hi>fru≈øtration</hi> of all their coun≈øels and devices, they being able no more to plot any thing again≈øt God, or his Church. Hitherto they prevailed in ruinating man-kind: but they ≈øhall from hence-forth want braines to bring to pa≈ø≈øe ≈øuch another worke, again≈øt any of Gods darlings. The beating out of their braines, and brui≈øing in peeces of all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, ≈øhall be by the ≈øeed of a woman, that is, by Chri≈øt, and that by the heele, to wit, the humiliation of him in our fle≈øh, and vpon the cro≈ø≈øe. In which he ≈øhall ≈øo eagerly pur≈øue the Devils, and ≈øtrike ≈øo mightily at their heads, that in breaking of them he ≈øhall brui≈øe him≈øelfe. He ≈øhall tread ≈øo hard vpon the enemy, as if his very heele ≈øhould ake with it. <hi>Shuph,</hi> the originall word, as it were, by an <hi>onoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topaeia,</hi> or fained found, ≈øignifies the ≈øhuffling of feete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and it is giuen both to Chri≈øt, and the Devill, who ≈øhould (as it were) wre≈øtle together, and that Chri≈øt ≈øhould over-throw his enemy, and cru≈øh him in peeces, e≈øpecially his head, the ≈øeat of wit and will, which by a Metonymie of the cau≈øe for the effect, ≈øignifies Satans devices, &amp;c. and his heele, a metaphor from the lowe≈øt part in man, to ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, the deba≈øement and humiliation of Chri≈øt, wherein he ≈øhould ≈øuffer, the Devill being a principall agent of all his ≈øorrowes: but Satan ≈øhould rue his intermedling, when he ≈øhould feele the knocke giuen by Chri≈øt, yea, and grieue that he had ever ≈øo much to doe with a woman, who≈øe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie he ≈øhould now find as bitter, as ever he felt ≈øweetnes in her friend≈øhip. <hi>Eue</hi> thought ≈øhee was the woman, when ≈øhee brought forth <hi>Cain,</hi> as if ≈øhe had now po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed a man of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> to doe all this; but by the name of her next ≈øon <hi>Abel,</hi> ≈øhe ≈øaw the vanitie of her owne opinion; yet <hi>Adam</hi> after he had receiued the promi≈øe, rightly called her <hi>Eue,</hi> not onely becau≈øe wee ≈øhould be the mother of all the liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that in her might remaine a memoriall, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ≈øhould come to be an in≈øtrument of life, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14.15. Furthermore, here is all our comfort, that Satan is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3808:116"/>≈øtinted to the heele of the true Chri≈øtian ≈øeed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øhall never breake their heads by Apo≈øta≈øie, though he may brui≈øe their heeles by manifold ≈ølips and ≈ølidings. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. Other puni≈øhments, as con≈øequents of this, are to be gathered, though no more bee expre≈ø≈øed. Ob≈øerue then, in the ≈øecond place, the <hi>obduration,</hi> and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them in their ≈øinnes, that they cannot repent, and finde mercie. And the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe they were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this ≈øinne, neither compelled, nor ≈øeduced; for, fir≈øt their vnder≈øtandings were cleare, they knew the truth, &amp; that di≈øtinctly; ≈øecondly, their wills were good by creation, and they had power to haue obeyed GODS command: but again≈øt all this goodne≈ø≈øe of God they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe them≈øelues, and devi≈øe which way they may cro≈ø≈øe God, and ≈øo ≈øinne again≈øt the holy Gho≈øt. The <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> knew Chri≈øt to be of God, and were convinced in con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the truth he taught, yet ≈øought they by all meanes to di≈øgrace him, and ≈øo ≈øinned like the Devils. Con≈øcience in both, may ≈øome-times checke them; yet as an vnruly dogge, that ≈øeeth the cudgell, and would be gone, flyes in the face of his ma≈øter, if he ≈øee no wayes to e≈øcape; ≈øo they may tremble. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. and yet triumph in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; for they cannot repent, they rather laugh at their ≈øinne, and dance in their wicked cour≈øes, then are any wayes moued, to cry for mercy; and ≈øo <hi>ip≈øofacto</hi> are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all hope of happine≈ø≈øe.

Euery ≈øinfull creature is ≈øtubble, and ≈øo is not able to ≈øtand in the pre≈øence of God, which is a con≈øuming fire: It is for Chri≈øt and Chri≈øtians, that Devils and wicked men feele not the full extent of Gods wrath. God will haue them to exerci≈øe the graces and vertues of his ≈øervants: and ≈øo by accident they are pre≈øerved, and re≈øerved to the generall a≈ø≈øize, and fire of hell; Chri≈øt ≈øhall come in fire and that fire ≈øhall be the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the elements, which ≈øhall be confounded as in one ma≈ø≈øe. The ayre is oyly, and the earth is full of combu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, as coales, and brim≈øtone. Many pits are full of ≈ølime; and as the Countrey where <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ≈øtood, was very bituminous, clammie clay, and glewi≈øh ground, with ≈øtore of ≈ølime pits, and ≈øo very fit for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling of that matter, which was afterwards rained downe vpon them: ≈øo the place that God is now a preparing for the damned, may very well be in the confu≈øion of all the elements together, where fire ≈øhall fearefully ≈øeize vpon all things, and God even prepare all as matter, or fuell for his rage. I heare not that the fire ≈øhall be quenched againe in which Chri≈øt ≈øhall come. And the fire of hell is vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and may even in this become vtter darkne≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe the Starres ≈øhall fall, and melt away, and the powers of heaven ≈øhall be ≈øhaken, and (as it were) driuen to the earth, and therefore the ≈øubiect of light being de≈øtroyed, vpon the earth, and within the earth may be this horrible dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and woefull fire. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.13.

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.26. The reprobate ≈øhall then be more narrowly confined, and more fearefully tormented. To conclude, learne further by this puni≈øhment of the Devils, that their fir≈øt ≈øinne was in tempting of man: for we ≈øee that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of them, is onely inflicted for this their rebellion, and their continuing in it: yea, marke further, how God hath puni≈øhed the rebells in their enuie, they enuied mans e≈øtate by creation, and ≈øcorned to ≈øerue him; they ≈øhall now ≈øee him advanced into their roomes, and them≈øelues impri≈øoned vpon that mi≈øerable earth, which they conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a Paradi≈øe into a pri≈øon, from a delicate palace into a mo≈øt damnable dungeon. Thus whiles enuie feeds on others evils, and hath no di≈øea≈øe but his neighbours well fare, it hath all tho≈øe favours fall be≈øide it ≈øelfe, which it grudged to ≈øee in others. It is nothing but a pale &amp; leane carca≈øe, quickned with a <hi>Fiend;</hi> &amp; it keepes the wor≈øt diet, for it con≈øumes it ≈øelfe, and delights in pining. A thorne hedge covered with netles, that cannot be dealt withall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tenderly, or roughly. What peevi≈øh interpreters of good things were the Devils, that had rather ≈øtep into hell, then ≈øtoop a little to their Creator, in ≈øeruing of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or creature, which now they ≈øee more honoured then ever before.</p>

The≈øe wormes were worthy creatures of God, but now mo≈øt wretched, and a≈øhamed to appeare abroad, and therefore liue in the earth, and are ≈øeldome to be ≈øeene. Their skins paine them if they liue long, and alwayes it is painefull vnto them to crawle, or creepe, becau≈øe the belly is their ≈øofte≈øt part, and oppre≈ø≈øed with the guts and body lying vpon it.

The fir≈øt bond is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and therefore God and man are parted, as really and truely, in regard of ≈øpirituall life, as when the naturall ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3808:119"/>are extingui≈øht, body and ≈øoule flie a≈øunder. By the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Gods Spirit alone, mu≈øt a new life be created in vs, that was not, and not ≈øome former life excited: yea, further, wee are not pre-di≈øpo≈øed, and prepared of our ≈øelues, for the receiuing of it. As there is no vacuitie in nature, no more is there ≈øpiritually. Euery ve≈ø≈øell is full; if not of liquor, yet of ayre: and ≈øo is the heart of man; though (by nature) it is empty of grace, yet it is full of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocri≈øie, and iniquitie: neither can it be filled with grace, except it be emptied of the≈øe evill qualities: and as in a ve≈ø≈øell, ≈øo much water as goes in, ≈øo much ayre goes out: ≈øo in the narrow mouth'd ve≈ø≈øell of the heart, ≈øo much grace as comes in by drops, ≈øo much ≈øinne is expelled, and the fir≈øt expul≈øion is violent, man not co-working at all; for he is imformed (as it were) with ≈øinne, and is contrary to the worke of grace, the very wi≈øedome of his fle≈øh is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not ≈øecret, but publicke, in re≈øi≈øtance: neither doth, nor can ≈øubiect it ≈øelfe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>One hupota≈ø≈øetai, ou duna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai,</hi> two words that cut the very throat of our free-will, It ≈øubiects not, there is re≈øi≈øtance, and where there is re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, there is contrarietie; and contraries ≈øuffer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of one another. And the corrupt will is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to God by violence; I ≈øay not the will, for that is a ≈øubiect of both, and pa≈ø≈øiue in conver≈øion, ≈øuffering grace by violence to ca≈øt out ≈øinne. As farre as it oppo≈øeth by corruption, ≈øo farre is it con≈øtrained to yeeld by grace; and in the fir≈øt motion will not-≈øubiect, nay, becau≈øe of ≈øinne cannot: but the wheele once turned againe by grace, is as ready to doe well, as ever it was to doe evill. Onely Lord, I know, that by rea≈øon of this oppo≈øition, my ≈øoule will take a long time to emptie and fill, and that the be≈øt ve≈ø≈øell cannot be quite full, while it is in the body; becau≈øe there will be ≈øtill the≈øe remainders of corruption. Though I mu≈øt not be impatient of Gods delay, yet will I never re≈øt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tent with any mea≈øure of grace in this world: but will euery day endevour to haue one drop or another added to my ≈ømall quantitie: ≈øo ≈øhall my la≈øt day fill vp

And here the Lord, be≈øide the order of con≈øequence, and contrarietie, in puni≈øhing one ≈øinne with another, and making both bitter, and ≈øtinging to the con≈øcience, hath a double act: Fir≈øt, he limites the ≈øinne, what way, and how farre it ≈øhall goe. He hath a bit and bridle to curbe any ≈øinner. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.9. and when he is gone to the vtmo≈øt of his teather, he can pull him backe againe to his taske with ≈øhame.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God directeth ≈øinners evermore to his glory, they ≈øhall honour him when they thinke lea≈øt of it. They that never learned to li≈øpe a word of a better life, ≈øhall liue for God, when they die to damne them≈øelues. If good thoughts by re≈øtraining grace, looke into a wicked heart, they ≈øtay not there; as tho≈øe that like not their lodging, and therefore are ≈øoone gone. They ≈øcarce find an Inne to baite in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be baited out againe with mi≈ø-rule: onely that light of Gods loue, and countenance, that ≈øhines into an holy heart is con≈øtant, like that of the Sunne, which keepes due times, and varies not his cour≈øe, for any of the≈øe ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary occa≈øions: yet ble≈ø≈øed be God, who re≈øtraines the plots and practi≈øes of the wicked for the good of his elect.</p>

A profe≈ø≈øors ≈øinne is greater then the ≈øinne of a prophane man.

It is a greater vnkindne≈ø≈øe for a ≈øonne to offend his father, then another man, &amp;c. Habituall ≈øinnes are wor≈øe then actuall, and a railing habite is wor≈øe then a ≈ølip, or error of the tongue. Here may a que≈øtion be demanded, whether the ≈øinnes of the fir≈øt Table, or the ≈øecond are greater? An≈øwere; compare per≈øon with per≈øon, and then euery ≈øinne again≈øt God is more vile then again≈øt my neighbour: but other circum≈øtances may aggravate, and make a ≈øinne greater in the ≈øecond Table then the fir≈øt. Idle taking of Gods name in vaine, <hi>As O Lord, O Ie≈øus,</hi> are not ≈øo ill as Murther and Adultery. Negligence on the Sabboth, and ≈øtealing a nap by chance at a Sermon, is not ≈øo vile and villanous as to robbe and kill by the high wayes ≈øide: but let circum≈øtance goe with circum≈øtance, as per≈øon with per≈øon, degree with degree, &amp;c. and then euery ≈øinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the fir≈øt Table is wor≈øe then again≈øt the ≈øecond.</p>

It is not what harme, or hurt haue you done, but what health and helpe haue you beene to the needie? God made nothing to be idle, but euery thing to worke vnto his end, that the great worke-ma≈øter of all, might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his handy worke. This ≈øinne is not properly an act, but not acting, and for want of a tearme we call it actuall. It ≈øprings from originall ≈øinne, which makes vs vnapt to good.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øinne of commi≈ø≈øion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The doing of that evill wee ≈øhould not doe.</hi> Rom. 1.28. The≈øe two branches, or ≈øtreames of originall ≈øinne, ≈øhew vs the nature of the fountaine it ≈øelfe, that as it is dry and barren of good, ≈øo it ≈øends forth an Ocean of evill.

For as arts are concreted, and concreated with things, that is, God did (as it were) clap the art, and the thing together: ≈øo the Devil hath conglutinated and compacted the ≈øinne and the ≈øub≈øtance together. A Logician doth rea≈øon, It is not ≈øo much the man as his Logicke that performes the art: ≈øo it is not ≈øo much the man that makes a Garment, as the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, &amp;c. Hence we learne in the blacke Art of the Devill, that it is not ≈øo much the ≈øub≈øtance as the ≈øinne that doth evill; and that ≈øubiect onely ≈øinneth, which is glewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3808:121"/>with the ≈øinne, God therefore running along with the ≈øub≈øtance as well as the ≈øinne, and being in the action of the ≈øinner, as well as the ≈øinne, may doe that by his owne art, which neither the ≈øinne, nor the ≈øinner can be ≈øaid to doe, and ≈øo very well may puni≈øh the ≈øinner with his ≈øinne, and yet be no cau≈øe of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24.

                  <hi>A deprivation and lo≈ø≈øe of life, with a fearefull ≈øubiection to the mi≈øery of this life, and the life to come.</hi> Gen. 2.17. Rom. 6.23. Man by ≈øinne is made vnable to plea≈øe God, he mu≈øt therefore be di≈ø≈øolued and new made, or changed, that he may doe it. Death ≈øhould be farre more welcome vnto vs the ≈øinne: for that may prepare vs for heaven, when this will be ≈øure to ca≈øt vs into hell. Alas, is it not pitty to ≈øee our feare mi≈øplaced? All men feare to ≈øuffer evill, but few they are that feare to doe evill. Of two deaths we feare the le≈ø≈øe, and neuer dread the la≈øt and wor≈øt. There are but two ≈øtages of the fir≈øt, the <hi>bed,</hi> and the <hi>graue.</hi> The former, if it haue paine, yet it is ≈øpeedie, and the latter as it is ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3808:122"/>≈øo it giues re≈øt. Again≈øt this there are many <hi>Antidotes,</hi> and comforts, and we know that an evill that is ever in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot be fearefull: that onely which both time and tempe≈øt, nay, eternitie it ≈øelfe finds ≈øtanding, is worthy of terror. And let them tremble at it that delight to liue in the former puni≈øhment. As for the fir≈øt, there are no by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of a fairer, or neeerer way, all that travell to the holy land, mu≈øt be content to offer this tribute at the <hi>Pi≈øon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle,</hi> or gates of death, crownes and ≈øcepters lie piled at this entrance, and ≈øeeing God cannot re-edifie without taking downe of this old hou≈øe, I will welcome death. We receiue any homely me≈ø≈øenger from great per≈øonages, with due re≈øpect to their ma≈øters: and what matters it what death it be, ≈øo it bring me good newes? And what newes can be better then this, that God ≈øends for me, to make me more happie, then my cra≈øie carca≈øe will ≈øuffer me to be, till it be mended, and ca≈øt in a better mould. Let them feare death, which know him to be as a pur≈øuivant ≈øent from hell to fetch them: as for vs, we can pa≈ø≈øe chearefully through the blacke gates, or darke entry of a corporall death, vnto our glorious man≈øions aboue: but let vs proceede, to ≈øee both deaths, that by them wee may learne our mi≈øery, and ≈øee Gods greater mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What things are to be confidered in death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The inchoation and beginning, or the perfection and end.</hi> The beginning of any act is part of it, and when man ≈øets his hand to any thing, he is doing it. If there had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny act of ≈øpirituall life, man had liued, and God had beene well plea≈øed, and his life had beene immutable: ≈øo on the contrary, when man begins to die, he is a dying, and God ≈øayes in <hi>the very day that thou eate≈øt, or ≈øinne≈øt, thou ≈øhalt die.</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>Adam</hi> was left a dead man, as ≈øoone as hee had ta≈øted of the tree, and every man is cra≈øie from his cradle. The pace of death is ≈øoft and ≈øure, and euery man (liue he never ≈øo long) is a dying man till he be dead. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.22.61.65.</p>

Yet in nature the ≈øecond death is the fir≈øt; for, the ≈øoule dies fir≈øt in ≈øinne, the puni≈øhment being inflicted according to the fault. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, that is called the ≈øecond death, becau≈øe the extremitie of it is to begin after the end and perfection of the fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the fir≈øt death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Subiection to the mi≈øeries of this world.</hi> Iob 5.7. and 14.1. Earth was made mans Paradi≈øe, and Palace of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures: but now it is his true <hi>Bochim,</hi> as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> called their mourning place: We begin our life with teares, and therefore <hi>Lawyers</hi> define life by weeping; If a childe be heard cry, it is a lawfull proofe of his liuing, to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the mi≈øeries of this world: el≈øe if he be dead, we ≈øay he is ≈øtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne; and at our parting with this world, God is ≈øaid to wipe off our teares. Labour and paines goe now together, and one word <hi>[ponos]</hi> is ≈øufficient to expre≈ø≈øe both: whence we ≈øay, he that labours, takes paines, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ≈øayd to be in labour, when ≈øhe is in the travell, and paine of child-births yet by creation God made both to labour without paine; onely with ≈øinne paine ≈øeized vpon the bones, and the minde was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with a wearine≈ø≈øe, and irk≈øome loathing of what it mu≈øt doe. Looke into our fields, and there ≈øhall we finde toyling and moyling, and tyring of our ≈øelues at plough and ≈øithe: looke into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and there is tugging and tuing at the oares &amp; cables. Looke into Cities, and there is plodding vp and downe, and ≈øweating in ≈øhops, till men complaine of wearine≈ø≈øe. Looke into Schollers ≈øtudies, &amp; there is to≈ø≈øing of braines and bookes, ≈øcratching the head, even to palene≈ø≈øe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie. Looke into the mo≈øt plea≈øurable place vpon earth, the Courts of Princes, and there how are men wearied with tedious attendance, emulatory officiou≈øne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. Are not all things full of labour, and labour full of ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3808:123"/>Nay, If wee turne our ≈øelues to idlene≈ø≈øe, it is as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øome as worke.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The lo≈ø≈øe of the good things of the body, as the ≈øen≈øe of nakedne≈ø≈øe, of maie≈øtie,</hi> (whence comes ≈øhame) of <hi>comeline≈ø≈øe</hi> and <hi>beautie,</hi> as al≈øo of <hi>health,</hi> whence man is expo≈øed to wearine≈ø≈øe, dangers, ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, and a daily dying. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.21.22. Of all the creatures man was mo≈øt comely without a covering. Bea≈øts would be na≈øtie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out haire, and birds without feathers: God apparels them in their excrements, becau≈øe their temper was not ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite as mans, who≈øe beautie was to be bare: and I cannot but wonder, that pride ≈øhould be crept into clouts, which are the en≈øignes of ≈øhame. Our finene≈ø≈øe is our filthine≈ø≈øe, and our neatne≈ø≈øe our na≈øtine≈ø≈øe, if we grow proud of what ≈øhould humble vs. Againe, ≈øuch a maie≈øty was in man, that the very bruit bea≈øts ≈øhould haue revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ced it, which now being covered, they contemne and di≈øpi≈øe.

Sorrow for lo≈ø≈øe of friends, di≈øgrace in the creatures, turning out of Paradi≈øe, like ≈øome ba≈øe borne brood, vnworthy of ≈øuch a princely palace: if he might haue left it like a tenant, or ≈øold it like an owner, it had bin ≈øome credit vnto him: but to be ca≈øt out for a wrangler, &amp; haue the good Angels turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, which were created as his guard, mu≈øt needs much perplex his mind, &amp; could be no les then foeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ners of his end.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the perfection and end thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The going out of the Spirits, whereby the Soule departeth from the body, and the body afterwards is returned and re≈øolved into the earth, and other elements, whence it was taken.</hi> Gen. 3.19. Eccl. 12.7. Ob≈øerue, that neither ≈øoule nor body die, but onely the Spirits that hold them together: they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder by the extinction, con≈øumption, or congelation of the Spirits that runne along in the bloud, &amp;c. Here then is nothing but improvidence, that addes terror vnto this death. Let vs but thinke of it, and wee ≈øhall not feare it. Doe wee not ≈øee, that even Beares and Tigres ≈øeeme not terrible to tho≈øe that liue with them? how may wee ≈øee their keepers ≈øport with them, when the beholders dare ≈øcarce tru≈øt their chaine? Let vs then be acquainted with this death, and we ≈øhall be the better able to looke vpon his grimme countenance. I am a≈øhamed of this weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution, that we ≈øhould extoll death in his ab≈øence, and be ≈øo fearefull in his pre≈øence. Often in our ≈øpeculations haue wee freely di≈øcour≈øed of ≈øuch a friend, and now, that hee is come to our beds ≈øide, and hath drawne the Curtaines, and takes vs by the hand, and offers vs his ≈øervice, wee ≈øhrinke inward, and by the palene≈ø≈øe of our faces, and wildne≈ø≈øe of our eyes, wee bewray an amazement at the pre≈øence of ≈øuch a gue≈øt. Doe we not ≈øee that there is no
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3808:124"/>helpe to heale vs, but by pulling all a≈øunder? Lord, teach me while I liue, to die vnto ≈øinne, and liue vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe, that ≈øo when I ≈øhall die vnto nature, I may liue vnto glory. Our ≈øinne hath made it bitter, and thy mercy hath made it better then life Good <hi>Phy≈øitians</hi> when they apply their <hi>Leeches,</hi> ≈øcoure them with ≈øalt and nettles, and when their corrupt bloud is voyded, imploy them to the health of their Patients. This <hi>E≈øau</hi> in ≈øtead of frownes, ≈øhall meet vs with ki≈ø≈øes, and although wee receiue a blow from his rough hand, yet the very ≈øtripe and ≈øtroke ≈øhall be healing. I will therefore never grieue to tread in the ≈øteps of my Sauiour to glory. I know, my la≈øt enemy, by his goodne≈ø≈øe, ≈øhall be my fir≈øt friend in my pa≈ø≈øage to another world.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The ≈øubiection of man to the mi≈øeries of the world to come.</hi> Rom. 2.5. <hi>An heaping of wrath again≈øt the day of wrath.</hi> The little ≈øparke of immortality, and beame of Gods eternity, through ≈øinne, of an inualuable ble≈ø≈øing, becomes an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable cur≈øe, ≈øubiecting of vs to the mi≈øeries of another life: Oh, that we could feele this as well as the other, and vpon the fir≈øt groanes ≈øeeke for ea≈øe.

But it is no marvaile, ≈øeeing onely wi≈øe men ≈øeeke for remedies before their di≈øea≈øe: ≈øen≈øible patients, when they begin to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine: as for fooles they will doe it, too late. Oh that wee could weepe on earth, that wee might laugh in heauen. Who would not be content to deferre his ioy a little, that it may be perpetuall, and infinite? Better that wee ≈øhould weepe with men, and laugh with Angels, then fleering with worldlings, and iolly ones, to gna≈øh and howle with Devils.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the beginnings thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In this life as forerunners, emptine≈ø≈øe of good things, and fulne≈ø≈øe of evill, as ignorance of minde, terror of con≈øcience, and hence a flying from God, and hiding of our ≈øelues, rebellion of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3808:125"/>will, inordinate affections, finding the reines loo≈øe in their neckes, and like wild hor≈øes, carrying vs over hilles and rockes, and never leauing vs, till we be di≈ømembred, and they breathle≈ø≈øe; or on the contrary, if God re≈øtraine them by pulling them in with the ≈øudden violence of the ≈øtrait hand of his Iu≈øtice, they fall to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and careering, and never leaue till the ≈øaddle be emptie, and even then dangerou≈øly ≈øtrike at their pro≈øtrate rider:</hi> for after terror of con≈øcience, filthy lu≈øts get the dominion, and bring men into a deepe ≈øecuritie and ≈øen≈øele≈øne≈ø≈øe of their mi≈øery, and like blind <hi>Sodomites,</hi> they are groaping after evill, when God ≈ømites them. It is iu≈øt with God, that tho≈øe which want grace, ≈øhould want wit too: It is the power of ≈øinne, to turne men into ≈øtockes and ≈øtones. Ea≈øie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings neglected, end ever in de≈øtruction. His a mercy of God to warne vs by our con≈øciences: yet as ≈øome children grow carele≈ø≈øe with often whipping; ≈øo ≈øome ≈øinners grow more ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe, and ≈øtupid by the often &amp; frequent la≈øhes of their con≈øciences. But alas, ≈øecuritie and pre≈øumption attend, even at the thre≈øhold of ruine, and bring a man to be without all ≈øen≈øe and feeling of his mi≈øery: onely God who knowes by an vnwonted blow to fetch bloud out of the ≈øturdie≈øt heart, can ≈øo ≈øtrike, that con≈øcience after all this deadne≈ø≈øe, ≈øhall looke wonderfully aga≈øht vpon the ≈øinner, and driue him to horrible de≈øpaire. Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the racke of godle≈ø≈øe men; if one ≈øtraine make them not confe≈ø≈øe, let them be ≈øtretched one wrench hyer, and they cannot be ≈øilent; and therefore ≈øecuritie is euer accompanied with de≈øpaire in the end, and a fearefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of judgement. Nay, whiles they liue here, God doth often bring vpon them ≈øome extraordinary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus then you ≈øee the ≈øymptomes of the ≈øecond death, horror of con≈øcience, from whence flight and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultation ari≈øe; then ≈øecuritie breeding in men the ≈øen≈øele≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øinne, and de≈øpaire for it, and la≈øtly, ≈øome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary judgement of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. The things of this life when they come vpon the be≈øt tearmes, are but vaine; but when vpon ill conditions, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den≈øome;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3808:125"/>when they are at be≈øt, they are ≈øcarce friends: but when at wor≈øt, tormentors. Alas, poore worldlings. how ill agrees a gay coat, and a fe≈øtred heart? What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes an high title, with an hell in the Soule? Lord heale the≈øe evill ≈øymptomes of the ≈øecond ≈øorrow, lea≈øt I ≈øleepe in the mo≈øt mi≈øerable death.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the perfection of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>An eiection, or eternall ≈øeparation from the face of God, and an iniection, or ca≈øting of the Soule immediately after the fir≈øt death into hell,</hi> where there is an increa≈øing of ≈øinne, but more truely of torment, their ≈øinnes being turned into ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and they then finding no plea≈øure in evill; for ≈øinne being the greate≈øt mi≈øery, and mo≈øt oppo≈øite to good, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be the principall part of their torment. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, a re≈øervation of the body in the graue, as in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, again≈øt the di≈ø≈øolution of the world by fire, and day of judgement, when after the re≈øurrection, both body and ≈øoule, meeting together againe, ≈øhall be ca≈øt into hell fire, where there is both an increa≈øe of ≈øinne, of the gnawing worme of con≈øcience, and torment, and from hence wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, wayling, and gna≈øhing of teeth. Weeping is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion of ≈øorrow, and ≈øorrow cooles the heart, and cold makes the teeth to chatter, ≈øo that their torment and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery ≈øhall be intollerable. Sinne ≈øhall increa≈øe the worme of con≈øcience and con≈øcience ≈øhall make all to ≈øympathize with it in ≈øorrow, and ≈øorrow ≈øhall be angmented by fire and cold, ≈øuch paines ≈øhall the damned indure in hell, as never eye ≈øaw, nor eare heard, nor can po≈ø≈øibly enter into the heart of man. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.40.42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.41. 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. The Papi≈øts neare adioyning to hell make three places more, as <hi>Limbus,</hi> of the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chri≈øt, of <hi>Infants</hi> before Bapti≈øme, and of <hi>Purgatory</hi> for ≈øatisfaction. As a Caldron hath brimmes, and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; ≈øo hell is the bottome of the Caldron, Purgatory is the middle, and the Fathers, and Infants were in the brimme. Wee ≈øay in all ≈øcalding and fiery in≈øtruments, the greate≈øt heat is in the top: but this ≈øeething Caldron,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3808:126"/>though it did hemme in the Fathers, like the gard of a gowne, yet was it full of plea≈øure vnto them, onely infants being in the next border, had neither paine nor plea≈øure. Here is a rale of <hi>Limbus,</hi> without either welt or gard yet ≈øo plaine and palpable an error, that it confutes &amp; confounds it ≈øelfe. God, his law, mans life, his recompence, ≈øocietie, and Sauiour, doe all exclaime again≈øt ≈øuch dreames of <hi>Limbus,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Fir≈øt, God deales with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, either in iu≈øtice, or mercy. Secondly, his law is either broken, or kept; and of ≈øacrifices for all ≈øinnes and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, there are none appointed for the dead. The law then whom it ca≈øts in this world, it condemnes in the world to come without redemption; and God is iu≈øt in the highe≈øt degree, and therefore takes no expiation out of his ≈øonne, and if he once admit it in his ≈øonne, he is like wi≈øe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the highe≈øt degree, and therefore ≈øends none to <hi>Purgatory</hi> or <hi>Limbus,</hi> whom he ever meanes to recall backe againe. Thirdly, mans life either plea≈øeth, or di≈øplea≈øeth God, and all men walke but in two pathes; and ≈øo come accordingly to their ends. Fourthly, the recompence is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hell or heauen, the one prepared for the reprobate, the other, for the elect, and of a third place, Scripture makes no mention. A gaine, the ble≈ø≈øed re≈øt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, e≈øpecially, ≈øinne, and puni≈øhment: therefore the cur≈øed liue in both: and as ≈øin is the mo≈øt grieuous labour to the godly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. ≈øo ≈øhall it be the greate≈øt torment to the wicked. Either after the fir≈øt death we re≈øt from this painfull labour, which is a peece, yea, the greate≈øt part of our heauen: or el≈øe we liue in it, which is no le≈ø≈øe then hell it ≈øelfe. Fiftly, after the fir≈øt death wee meet with no other ≈øocietie, but either of Angels, or Devils. La≈øtly, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was a Lambe ≈ølaine from the beginning of the world, and ≈øo from that time rai≈øed againe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.24.25. <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ≈øhall ri≈øe againe, why? becau≈øe Chri≈øt is the re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he was not then actually dead, or rai≈øed. In the progre≈ø≈øe of a King, he him≈øelfe is the fir≈øt mouer, though many goe before him, all are attendants vpon his per≈øon,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3808:126"/>whether they goe before, or follow after. There is then no need to ≈øhut heauen again≈øt the Fathers, becau≈øe Chri≈øt was not then actually ri≈øen an a a≈øcended, for they all waite vpon Chri≈øt, though they goe before him vnto heauen. As for children they are either of faithful parents, or of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and therefore are they not excluded from grace and mercie. But I mu≈øt abbreviate, or el≈øe I ≈øhall grow infinite in laying downe of the precepts of this Art.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>By what right is ≈øinne propagated?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>By all kinds of right;</hi> fir≈øt by the <hi>law of Nations;</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was a Prince of all his po≈øteritie, who covenanted with God for vs, and for him≈øelfe, for the performance of obedience, and therefore he breaking, wee brake. He was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3808:127"/>al≈øo as our <hi>Legate,</hi> &amp; did lie as our <hi>Lidger,</hi> or deputie with God; and therefore wee may be ≈øaid to doe what≈øoeuer he did. He went as a common ≈øuretie for vs all, and on him was all our credite repo≈øed, and he was betru≈øted of God with the e≈øtate of vs all. It is therefore a nationall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, that wee comming all into one bond and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øhould all fare alike. Secondly, we haue it by the <hi>law of inheritance,</hi> he was our father, and we were his ≈øonnes, hee the roote, and we the branches, and therefore were to participate with him in all his e≈øtate.

Thirdly, by the <hi>law of divine Iu≈øtice,</hi> the perfection whereof cannot pardon the lea≈øt ≈øinne without ≈øatisfaction to euery farthing, as al≈øo by the infinitene≈ø≈øe of it that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ≈øelfe to euery guiltie per≈øon, and by rea≈øon of the violation of the law, and di≈øhonour of the law-giuer, deales mo≈øt ≈øtrictly and preci≈øely with euery ≈øinner.

It therefore followes by iu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent, that it proceeds from the vnion of both into one man; for, though our parents, as bruit bea≈øts beget not ≈øoules, yet they beget a more perfect creature, in that they are the procreant cau≈øes of man, vnited of his e≈ø≈øentiall cau≈øes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I haue gotten a man from the Lord.

               <p>A. <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>food</hi> are the principles of our life, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and pre≈øervation: the fir≈øt we haue from our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which is deadly, as poy≈øoned with ≈øinne: the other comes from our ≈øelues, being ignorant of what ≈øhould bee good for our bodies; but be≈øide the fir≈øt death, there is a conveyance of the ≈øecond, we being borne the children of wrath; for Gods di≈øplea≈øure was kindled as well again≈øt <hi>Adams</hi> po≈øteritie, as <hi>Adam</hi> him≈øelfe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is Eue made partaker of Adams puni≈øhment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Be≈øides her proper puni≈øhments, as an in≈øtrument of evill, ≈øhee participates with Adam in all we haue ≈øaid;</hi> for God made them both equally, for an happie e≈øtate, onely the wife was to inioy it by meanes of her husband; fir≈øt, as ≈øhee was taken out of him. Secondly, as they were to hold together for better and wor≈øe, in regard of their marriage. Thirdly, as ≈øhe was a companion with him in the ≈øame ≈øinne: they did both eate, ≈øinne, and ≈øee it at the ≈øame time. <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> 3.6.7.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Was propagation then from them both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, immediately from them both, as their children were begotten by the mutuall knowledge of the one the other.</hi> Gen. 4.1. and 5.3. Hence Chri≈øt was not borne ≈øinnefull, becau≈øe of the holy Gho≈øts ≈øeparation, not onely of the ≈øeed of <hi>Mary,</hi> but likewi≈øe of <hi>Mary</hi> from <hi>Io≈øeph.

Here we need not doubt vnder Chri≈øt, without feare of <hi>premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> or offence to the crowne and dignitie of the iu≈øtice of God, to affirme of faith in the merites of our Saviour, that its Gods ≈øtrong arme and power, to the enliuing and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of euery ≈øoule.

               <p>Q. <hi>What are the parts of our ri≈øing againe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; <hi>Redemption, and application.</hi> Ioh. 3.14. There is a lifting vp of Chri≈øt on his Cro≈ø≈øe, and a beleeuing in him for life. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Gods loue in giuing his ≈øonne for vs, and then application of him by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Redemption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>A ≈øatisfaction made vnto the in≈øtice of God for man by a Redeemer.</hi> Rom. 3.24.25.26. And here comes in the ≈øpeciall worke of the ≈øecond per≈øon: thus farre wee haue gone with the Fathers worke, both in Creation &amp; Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and now in a ≈øpeciall manner the Sonne doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt him≈øelfe; for the Father can goe no further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is it wrought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By a Mediator, who doth intercede betwixt God and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3808:129"/>man:</hi> the Father is offended, and cannot be reconciled without ≈øome mediation. All was made vnholy when the <hi>fir≈øt Adam</hi> ≈øinned; It is the <hi>≈øecond Adam</hi> that mu≈øt rectifie all; <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> the ≈øervant built the hou≈øe with a partition wall in the mid≈øt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.24. Chri≈øt the ≈øonne pulled downe that <hi>Screene,</hi> and ca≈øt all into one, bringing both Iew and Gentile into favour with God. The worke therefore is more properly a mediation then a redemption; or, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by mediation. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who is the Mediator?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, both God and man, who ye≈øterday, to day, and for ever, is the Saviour of mankinde.</hi> They that were ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterday, yea, from the worlds beginning, were ≈øaued by him alone, ≈øo they that liue to day, or ≈øhall come afterwards into the world, doe all expect for ≈øalvation by him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. He redeemes, becau≈øe we are captiues; he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates, becau≈øe there is a controver≈øie betwixt God and vs, and that continually, becau≈øe Gods wrath would ever be breaking forth, except our Mediator ≈øtood in the gap for vs.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is Chri≈øt called Ie≈øus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Becau≈øe the end of his mediation was to bring vs to ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Mo≈øes</hi> brings the people into the wilderne≈ø≈øe: but <hi>Io≈øhna,</hi> a type of Chri≈øt, into <hi>Canaan. Mo≈øes</hi> dies in the de≈øert, and ≈øees not the promi≈øed land: ≈øhewing plainely, that the law can lead vs into de≈øolation, but Chri≈øt, and the Go≈øpell mu≈øt bring vs out of it. <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> a Captaine of Gods people, and a type of the law, carries them out of captivitie: ≈øo the law, when it ≈øayth, <hi>Doe and liue,</hi> ≈øhewes plainely, how man may be ≈øaued: but <hi>Io≈øhua</hi> a prie≈øt, or ≈øacrificer, mu≈øt be ioyned with him, or el≈øe in <hi>Canaan</hi> it ≈øelfe, the people were to be ca≈øt out againe. The≈øe were liuely types of Chri≈øt, by whom alone wee are brought to heaven, and confirmed in the happine≈ø≈øe of it. <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.6.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why Chri≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>As Ie≈øus is the proper name; ≈øo this is the name of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3808:129"/>and it ≈øignifies, his anointing. Kings, Prie≈øts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were all anointed, as types of Chri≈øt to come. Henee the name <hi>Me≈ø≈øias;</hi> in whom the materiall anointing cea≈øeth, he receiued the thing ≈øignified by it aboue all his fellowes. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27. <hi>and</hi> 10.38. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.16. Both the Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tell vs of Chri≈øt bequeathed, and teach vs, that hee was that Chri≈øt, that is de≈øcribed in both: hence in the old Te≈øtament, we haue Prie≈øtly, Princely, and Propheticall Bookes: ≈øo in the new, the Go≈øpels are regall, ≈øhewing that Chri≈øt was that King of the Iewes. The Epi≈øtles are more ≈øacerdoticall, beginning for the mo≈øt part with prayers and ≈øupplications. And the Revelation of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> is meerely Propheticall. And all the≈øe are nece≈ø≈øary in Chri≈øt, to make him a complete Saviour: we ≈øtand in need of them all, and of their daily exerci≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why ≈øhould Chri≈øt be a Prophet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he might reveale vnto man the will of his Father, and be the onely Doctor of the Church.</hi> Luk. 4.18. <hi>Chri≈øt was anointed to preach the Go≈øpell.</hi> Deut. 18.15.18. Math. 21.11. Luk. 7.16.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why a Prie≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he might make a full ationement with the Father for man, and reconcile vs daily vnto him, both by his expiation and interce≈ø≈øion.</hi> Math. 20.28. Luk. 4.18. 1 Ioh. 2.2. &amp; 4.10. P≈øal. 110.4. Zech. 6.13. Heb. 5.6. &amp; 7.3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why a King?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he might rule and governe them, whom as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet he had taught, and as a Prie≈øt he had reconciled to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øubduing his and their enemies, and procuring them peace and pro≈øperitie continually.</hi> P≈øal. 2.6. Math. 21.5. Rev. 17.14. &amp; 19.16.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why God and man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he might redeeme vs by paying a price ≈øufficient:</hi> as likewi≈øe being Mediator, he might communicate with both natures, which were by him to be reconciled; that being inferior to his Father as touching his manhood, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3808:130"/>≈øuperior to man as touching his God-head, he might the better bring both together againe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>and</hi> 9.15. <hi>and</hi> 12.24. Hence in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, the name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and in Greeke, <hi>Theanthroopos. I≈øa.</hi> 7.14. God-man, or God with vs, and in our fle≈øh.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is here to be ob≈øerved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Two things; The di≈øtinction of the≈øe two natures, and their per≈øonall vnion.</hi> Io. 1.1. The word was God. <hi>v.</hi> 14 The word was made fle≈øh. Truely God, truely man, and yet but one Mediator.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the di≈øtinction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby the two natures remaine di≈øtinct in him, both in them≈øelues, and their properties.</hi> Math. 28.20. Vbiquitie is proper to the divinitie of Chri≈øt, and not his humanitie. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7. Ab≈øence proper to the humane nature. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. God manife≈øted in the fle≈øh, not confounded with it. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. Dying and quickning are proper to the di≈øtinct natures of Chri≈øt. Yet this we are to vnder≈øtand, that there is a tropicall communion of properties, in regard of the whole, wherein the≈øe parts are vnited, as God dies, that is, he that is both God and man. The people thought, Chri≈øt did contradict him≈øelfe, and the Scriptures. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Me≈ø≈øias abideth for ever, and thou ≈øaye≈øt, he dieth, &amp;c.</hi> Both the≈øe are true, <hi>Me≈ø≈øias</hi> liueth when he dieth, and dyeth when he liueth. There was never a ≈øeparation of his two natures, though body and ≈øoule parted for a while. Wee mu≈øt therefore hold, that neither the God-head is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time changed into the manhood, nor yet the manhood into the God-head. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. Furthermore, we are to learne, that Chri≈øts humane nature is like vnto ours in all things, but in ≈øinne, and manner of ≈øub≈øi≈øting. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>and</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the per≈øonall vnion of the≈øe two natures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby the nature a≈ø≈øuming, and nature a≈ø≈øumed make one Me≈ø≈øias, or Mediator betwixt God and man:</hi> the nature a≈ø≈øuming, is infinite, and his action is incomprehen≈øible; yet this we may ≈øafely affirme, that the ≈øecond per≈øon in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3808:130"/>Trinitie immediately a≈ø≈øumes, and then the God-head: ≈øo that our fle≈øh is fir≈øt taken by a per≈øon, and hence our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a≈ø≈øumed, is without all per≈øonall ≈øub≈øi≈øtence in it ≈øelfe, and is in≈øeparably conioyned with the divine nature, and doth wholly ≈øub≈øi≈øt, that is, the whole manhood ≈øub≈øi≈øts in the whole God-head; for whole God is in heauen, &amp; whole God is on earth, becau≈øe the divine nature hath no parts, and ≈øo our fle≈øh is not in a part of the God-head, but wholly in the whole. And yet not euery where with the whole. For the a≈ø≈øumption is not by way of exten≈øion, as a forme extends his matter: but of ineffable vnion, humane nature hauing no ≈øtanding of it ≈øelfe, but by the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is locally circum≈øcribed, as hauing quantitie, and con≈øi≈øts as a finite thing within the limites of e≈ø≈øence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truely compounded of matter, and forme. And yet it hath neither parts, nor pa≈ø≈øions, e≈ø≈øence, or accidents, which are not a≈ø≈øumed vnto the divine nature: when body and ≈øoule were a≈øunder, and locally in diver≈øe places, then were both of them in≈øeparably knit vnto the God-head. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 2.9. The Papi≈øts ≈øay, Chri≈øt was Mediator according to his humane nature, which is contrary to this per≈øonall vnion; for, as the per≈øon a≈ø≈øuming, giues the nature a≈ø≈øumed ≈øub≈øi≈øtence, ≈øo action, and it is not able to doe any thing without it. Therefore according to both natures, Chri≈øt redeemes, and the worke is not to be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Furthermore, we ≈øay the ≈øecond per≈øon a≈ø≈øumes, not the fir≈øt, for he is principally offended; not the third, for he is to te≈øtifie of the reconciliation: yet ≈øuch is the vnion that wee come by it, both to the Father, and the Spirit. For immediately the ≈øecond per≈øon a≈ø≈øumes, then the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hauing fellow≈øhip with that, wee haue it al≈øo with the Father and Spirit. Now if the divine nature ≈øhould fir≈øt a≈ø≈øume, then would the action be the Fathers; or if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then ≈øhould the Father haue two Sonnes, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he was made ≈øubiect to the iu≈øtice of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what≈øoever the ≈øame might require for the redemption of man.</hi> Rom. 10.4. Gal. 4.4. Heb. 7.22. Chri≈øt became our Suretie, and ≈øo bound him≈øelfe to pay all our debts. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts ≈øay, Chri≈øt is a Mediator betweene him≈øelfe, and vs; but they are ignorant, how a ≈øinne may more peculiarly be again≈øt one per≈øon, then another; as the manhood it ≈øelfe is more properly vnited to the ≈øecond per≈øon, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chri≈øt doth principally mediate betwixt the Father and man; and yet the ju≈øtice of the whole Deitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently of euery per≈øon is ≈øatisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What did the iu≈øtice of God require?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Two things; Satisfaction for the tre≈øpa≈ø≈øe, or payment of the forfaiture, and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe an≈øwerable to the law, for the payment of the principall.</hi> The one frees vs from death; the other, brings vs to life. By the fir≈øt wee are made no ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by the ≈øecond wee are made iu≈øt. The law ≈øtands ≈øtill in force for death, and life, ≈øinne and die, is by Chri≈øts death ≈øatisfied, doe and liue, is by his life fulfilled. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. Chri≈øt reconciles to God by ≈øuffering, and of enemies makes vs friends: but wee neither de≈øerue, nor can iu≈øtly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3808:131"/>de≈øire any thing, vntill he bring his owne righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe for vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein con≈øi≈øts all this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the conformitie of him≈øelfe, both for him≈øelfe, and vs, to he image of God, and the law, its performing perfect obedience thereunto, as al≈øo in vnder going for his ≈øuch death and dolors as were requi≈øite.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the image of God, and bound to keepe the law for him≈øelfe, and vs: ≈øo Chri≈øt mu≈øt be conformed in nature to Gods image, and in all his actions to his Pathers will. He is holy and iu≈øt, both for vs, and him≈øelfe; but his ≈øufferings are onely for vs, and not him≈øelfe. And here two que≈øtions ari≈øe; fir≈øt, whether his originall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and actiue obedience, were onely for him≈øelfe, his pa≈ø≈øiue onely for vs, and ≈øufficient for our ≈øaluation; It may be obiected, by his bloud we are ≈øaued, &amp;c. An≈ø: Here a part is put for the whole; for, we are ≈øaued as well by his life, as by his death, and they are both of them, both actiue and pa≈ø≈øiue. Chri≈øt ≈øuffered in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concelued, and he was no looner made man, &amp; made vnder the law, but he began to pay for vs; for, as <hi>Adam</hi> dyed as ≈øoone as he had ≈øinned ≈øo Chri≈øt ≈øuffered as ≈øoone as he became our ≈øuretie; therefore his whole life &amp; death are for vs, and our payment. He that dies by the law is not acquitted, or iu≈øtified, but condemned. He that makes <hi>fal≈øe Lature</hi> may be pardoned, or puni≈øhed, but not iu≈øtified. Euery law acquits, when men are found to haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again≈øt it: but it moreouer rewards, when ≈øubiects are found to performe the vtmo≈øt required by it. Chri≈øt therefore is to ≈øuffer and ≈øatisfie; but that will not iu≈øtifie vs, except further be found in him, that he hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again≈øt the law, nay, al≈øo that he hath to the height and ful mea≈øure fulfilled it. We haue need both of originall and actuall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe to bring vs to heauen, and out of him it is not to befound. The ≈øecond controuer≈øie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ≈øecond death, which is the puni≈øhment of the damned, and therefore not fit for Chri≈øt to ≈øuffer. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this we acknowledge that Chri≈øt did not, neither could truely, and properly ≈øuffer the ≈øecond death, which is a ca≈øting out and bani≈øhment from ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, and the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3808:132"/>fauour of God. God forbid that any Chri≈øtian ≈øhould haue ≈øuch a thought of our Lord Chri≈øt, who euer ≈øince his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>A. <hi>Two; His life and death:</hi> there is nothing in the whole hi≈øtory of Chri≈øts life and death, but it makes for vs, all our liuing and dying, ≈øeruing for no better v≈øe, but to make vs mi≈øerable. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.11. <hi>and</hi> 18.37.

               <p>A. <hi>His willing vnder-going of the mi≈øeries of this life for vs, and the full ≈øanctification of ours in all points;</hi> from the ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ≈øeed, to the ≈øeparation of his Soule, he liued for vs, and our good.

               <p>Q. <hi>How was his ≈øoule created and adorned?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Immediately of nothing, and infu≈øed with great perfection,</hi> but not ≈øo ab≈øolute, as that it receiued no after increa≈øe of knowledge, and wi≈øedome. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.40.52. He increa≈øed as well with God as man; and therefore he receiued not all at once, to manife≈øt afterwards, as need required.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is his nativitie, or birth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whereby he was borne of the Virgin Mary, who was of the hou≈øe of Dauid.</hi> Hence Chri≈øt is the Sonne of the <hi>ten Fathers</hi> of all the world, more e≈øpecially, of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> being peculiar types of Chri≈øt. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the promi≈øe renued vnto him, by calling him out of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> a type of heaven, where Circumci≈øion, a badge of ≈øeparation was in≈øtituted, &amp; the Church brought more particularly into one Nation, that the line &amp; lineage of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øias</hi> might the better be knowne; afterwards it comes to <hi>Dauid,</hi> who≈øe kingdome was made a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar type of Chri≈øt.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3808:133"/>the kingdome, though he never came the ordinary way. <hi>Math.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the end.

Whiles the fooli≈øh lewes gloried in their Temple, the Lord de≈øtroyed it, to ≈øhew them, that it was not an earthly but a ≈øpirituall Temple, that he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and remoued the government from <hi>Dauid,</hi> and from <hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Leui,</hi> and then to a very ≈øtranger, an <hi>Edomite,</hi> checking them very often, before his birth, for their vaine conceit, both of Church and Common-wealth. And yet it ≈øeemes Chri≈øt had ≈øome con≈øanguinitie, both with the Princely and Prie≈øtly progenie. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.36. he came to ≈øaue of all ≈øorts of men, and therefore ≈øpread farre in his race.

And our ble≈ø≈øed Sauiour, who would fulfil euery type, mini≈øtred not till he was thirtie yeere old. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. yet all the time of his private life, he liued for vs, even to ≈øanctifie vnto vs, as well our dayes ≈øpent in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as publicke.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His infancie, and time of ≈øubiection to his parents,</hi> both needfull for vs, ≈øeeing wee offend God being Children, as well as in the yeares of di≈øcretion. Infants are no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents before God, but even then provokers of GODS wrath, though they haue not wit to ≈øinne with ≈øo high an hand again≈øt God as others. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7.51.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is revealed concerning his infancie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His Circumci≈øion, oblation, and flight into Aegypt.</hi> As a Iew he was to vnder-goe the Ceremonies that belonged vnto them, yea, and to put an end vnto them.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by his Circumci≈øion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>He was circumci≈øed, not becau≈øe he needed that him≈øelfe, as if corruption had beene in him, which mu≈øt be cut off by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: but for that he was to fulfill the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and put an end to all ceremonies, and to ≈øhew that the force of that Sacrament, which did ≈øcale vnto the Fathers their reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God depended on him, and that in him was found, that which ought to be in euery circumci≈øed per≈øon, a pure and an vndefiled heart.</hi> Luk. 2.21. It was not onely a ≈øeale, or ≈øigne of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but al≈øo a bond, or obligation of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Chri≈øt therefore being circumci≈øed, bound him≈øelfe to keepe the law, both for vs and him≈øelfe. This importable yoke was layd vpon his necke. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Hence, at his circumci≈øion he had his name <hi>Ie≈øus,</hi> for by binding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to the law, he ≈øaued vs. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. There were two that had this name in the old Te≈øtament, the one, a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, the other, a mini≈øter.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by his offering?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It was to ≈øhew, that he indeed was the fir≈øt borne that was to be dedicated to the Lord, whereof all others were but types.</hi> Luk. 2.22.23.24. <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.1.2.3.4.5. &amp;c. is ≈øet downe both the ≈øeparation and purification of women. The one, in regard of originall ≈øinne, the other, in regard of actuall. The Ma≈ø≈øe ≈øeparates from God, and yet when the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of that is ≈øealed by circumci≈øion, yet ≈øtill remaines a daily purification. After the Leper was wa≈øhed, he was to ≈øhaue off his hayre, ≈øhewing how the ≈øuperfluities of ≈øinne were daily to be purged away. Furthermore, becau≈øe the female was more moy≈øt then the male, there was a longer time pre≈øcribed for the one, then the other. The ≈øeparation for a male was ≈øeven dayes, for a female foureteene. The purification for a man child, thirtie three dayes for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ≈øixtie ≈øixe. Now <hi>Mary</hi> needed neither of the≈øe, for Chri≈øt was borne free from all ≈øinne, both originall and actuall, he was <hi>the holy of holies.</hi> Dan. 9.24. yet becau≈øe he was our Suretie, his mother was ≈øeparated ≈øeven dayes, and he was circumci≈øed the eighth, and when ≈øhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed thirtie-three dayes of purification, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented vnto God, all this was to ≈øhew that her ≈øeed tooke vpon him all our debt, and was content that his Father ≈øhould impute vnto him, both our originall and actuall ≈øinne, and that by him wee ≈øhould be purified from both. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. That which dwells in vs is laid vpon him: his offering was a paire of turtles, to ≈øhew that innocency that was in him, and ought to be in his Church. He offered not the Lambe, becau≈øe the ≈øub≈øtance being there, the ≈øhadow was to vani≈øh; as al≈øo that he became poore for our ≈øakes. Againe, he was pre≈øented, as the fir≈øt borne, to ≈øanctifie all others, and pre≈øerue them aliue. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Aegypts</hi> fir≈øt borne was ≈ømitten, becau≈øe they wanted the blood of the Lambe. And as types of Chri≈øt ever after, the fir≈øt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3808:135"/>borne were either con≈øecrated, or redeemed. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.12. Of bea≈øts, onely the vncleane were redeemed, the re≈øt ≈øacrificed. <hi>Num.</hi> 18.15. And of men, God would haue all redeemed. Chri≈øt therefore in all con≈øecrations was typified, as the price of euery mans redemption, being before God vncleane; yea, the very ≈øtrength of man. <hi>Gen</hi> 49 3. could not ≈øtand out with the wrath of God; but for this that Chri≈øt hath ran≈øomed it. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.19. Furthermore, the fir≈øt borne had a right aboue all the re≈øt. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.17. And they were to depend vpon their elder brother. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.31. <hi>and</hi> 27.36. <hi>and</hi> 49.3. Hence Chri≈øt <hi>Math.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. is called that fir≈øt borne, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. among≈øt many brethren. Yea, ≈øets him aboue Kings, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 89.27.

               <p>A. <hi>That he might therein al≈øo fulfill the type and prophecie of God, in calling his ≈øonne out of Aegypt; and that therein wee might learne, how he was to de≈øcend into ≈øpirituall Aegypt, to beare our labours and ≈øtripes, and bring vs out of thraldome and bondage into ≈øpirituall Canaan.</hi> Math. 2.13.14. <hi>I≈ørael</hi> was borne in <hi>Canaan,</hi> went downe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and came backe againe triumphantly.

His infancy was mo≈øt ≈øpent in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as being our mo≈øt vnprofitable time; but his education mu≈øt be in <hi>Canaan:</hi> but not as a King in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem,</hi> P≈øal. 110.2. or <hi>Bethlehem, Dauids</hi> citie. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. but in greater ob≈øcuritie, befitting his humiliation, in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret,</hi> a place both ba≈øe and wicked. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.52. with 1.46.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3808:139"/>they ≈øo much the more bitter;</hi> and whiles he was on the cro≈ø≈øe tho≈øe three houres of darkene≈ø≈øe, he was a≈ø≈øayled with all the powers of darkene≈ø≈øe, ≈øo that he felt in his ≈øoule and body vnvtterable angui≈øhes, even the effects or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the mo≈øt feareful wrath of God, ≈øo that it made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> and when that was over, as hauing felt therein the mo≈øt bitter paines of all his ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, he ≈øaid it was <hi>fini≈øhed.</hi> Math. 27.45.46. Ioh. 19.30.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What might this meane?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he was for the time reputed as one ≈øeparated from God, which is the ≈øecond death;</hi> for as the fir≈øt death is the reparation of the ≈øoule from the body, the beginning of our naturall life: ≈øo the ≈øecond death is the ≈øeparation of both body and ≈øoule from God, the beginning of that ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 53.4.5.6.10. Chri≈øt was never a ≈øtranger to the life of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. and yet his Father did for a ≈øpace ≈øeeme to e≈øtrange him≈øelfe to his Sonne. Oh, beloued Saints of God, let vs, with that Di≈øciple, follow him a far off; and pa≈ø≈øing over all his contemptuous v≈øage in the way, ≈øee him thus brought to his Cro≈ø≈øe, and ≈øtill the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee looke, the more wonders ≈øhall wee behold. Euery thing addes to his ignominy of ≈øuffering, and triumph of over-comming. It was not done in a corner, as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith to <hi>Fe≈øtus,</hi> but in <hi>Ieru≈øalem,</hi> the eye, the heart of the world; and that without the gates; in <hi>Calvary,</hi> among the ≈øtinking bones of execrable Malefactors. Before, the glory of the place bred ≈øhame; now, the vilene≈ø≈øe of it. Not a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, but argues the wonderfull humiliation of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and ≈øtill his paine and ≈øcorne increa≈øed till all was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Hitherto of his life; what is his death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The expiration, and deliuering vp of his ≈øoule into the hands of his Father.</hi> Math. 27.50. Luk. 23.46. Ioh. 19.30. When he had fini≈øhed all, and indured mo≈øt exqui≈øite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he him≈øelfe without all violence gaue vp the Gho≈øt. For he both cryed with a lowd voyce, and bowed the head immediately before he yeelded his la≈øt breath; whereas in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3808:140"/>mans death the ≈øpirits fir≈øt faint and tyre, and the head fals downe when they are expired: but Chri≈øt being full of ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, able to hold vp his head, bends the ≈øame downe-ward of his owne accord, and then dies. Oh, yee ≈øinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Chri≈øts head thus humbly bowed downe in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous re≈øpect to you; his armes are ≈øtretched out louingly to embrace you; yea, his precious ≈øide is open to receiue you, there is no more accu≈øation, iudgement, death, hell for you: all the≈øe are no more to you, then if they were not, if yee can beleeue, <hi>who ≈øhall condemne?</hi> It is Chri≈øt which is dead. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. I know euery man is ready to reach forth his hand to this dole of grace, and would be angry to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from this doore of mercy; ≈øurely, there is no want in this <hi>Mo≈ø≈øias,</hi> looke that the want be not in thy ≈øelfe: hee hath fini≈øhed, but thou beleeue≈øt not, thou repente≈øt not, all is in vaine to thee; for all the≈øe, thou mai≈øt be condemned. What ever Chri≈øt is, what art thou? Here is the doubt: <hi>Chri≈øt is a good ≈øhepherd, and giues his life for his ≈øheepe:</hi> But what is this to thee, that art ≈øecure, prophane, impenitent, thou art a wolfe, or a goat. <hi>Chri≈øts ≈øheepe heare his voyce,</hi> but thou art a rebell to his law, and therefore can≈øt not hearken to his Go≈øpell for mercie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is his death to vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Chri≈øt was willingly content to indure the ≈øeparation of his body and ≈øoule for a time, which is the fir≈øt death, that hee might take away what≈øoeuer is iudgement therein, and ≈øanctifie the ≈øame vnto vs.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.55.56.57. Wee were the authors of this death, and our Saviour did alter it, our di≈øobedience made it bitter, his mercy hath made it not to be evill vnto vs. Oh, my Saviour, how halt thou perfumed and ≈øoftened this bed of my graue by dying? How can it grieue mee to tread in thy ≈øteps to glory? The wor≈øt peece of the horror of this death is the graue, and that part which is corrupted feeles it not; the other, which is free from corruption, feeles an abundant recompence, and forefees a ioyfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Wee carry heauen and earth wrapt vp in one
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3808:140"/>compound; it is but re≈øtitution, when each part returnes homeward.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followed his death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His buriall, and abiding in the graue, to the end, that hee might ≈øweeten the ≈øame for vs;</hi> and whereas it was by rea≈øon of ≈øinne, a dungeon, to re≈øerue the guiltie body again≈øt the day of judgement, it is through him become (as it were) a perfumed bed for the elect, again≈øt the day of Re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Math</hi> 27.59.60. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.53. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57.2. Buriall comes of burning, an auncient cu≈øtome of burning bodies, and then pre≈øerving their a≈øhes in a pitcher in the earth. Hence it may be that the Auncients to prevent an ab≈øurd conceit of this kind of Funerall concerning Chri≈øts body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not a bone was to be broken, or wa≈øted, added de≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell, to ≈øhew, that Chri≈øt was not burned, but bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by going downe into <hi>Sheol:</hi> but it is not for mee to determine the doubt, I leaue it to riper judgements. One thing more I adde, that buriall is ≈øometimes taken for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a body for the graue. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.12. <hi>This ≈øhee did to bury me, &amp;c.</hi> Chri≈øt died, was embalmed, and then interred.</p>

Woe were to vs if Chri≈øt had left but one mite of ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction vpon our ≈øcore, to bee di≈øcharged by our ≈øelues: and woe be to them that derogate from him to arrogate to them≈øelues, and would faine botch vp his ≈øufferings, with their owne ≈øuperfluities: hee would not off the Cro≈ø≈øe till all was done, and then hauing fini≈øhed, he went on with a ≈øecond worke, to build vp a perfect way to heauen vpon this foundation, and from the graue to his throne in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he chalked out for vs the everla≈øting way.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein doth the glory of his victory and triumph con≈øi≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Fir≈øt, in the depo≈øition and laying a≈øide of all infirmities. Secondly, in his a≈ø≈øumption and taking vp of all perfections, both of body and ≈øoule.</hi> His body was now no more to die but to receiue cele≈øtiall perfection. His ≈øoule had nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from it, no truth from his vnder≈øtanding, no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3808:141"/>from his will: vpon earth hee was ignorant of ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which now is perfectly revealed vnto him, he now knowes the day of judgement, and by his God-head hath euery thing revealed vnto his man-hood that is fit for the government of his Church, though he be ab≈øent from vs both in body and ≈øoule, that which neither Saint nor Angell can heare, he heares, and puts vp all petitions to his Father. His minde is ignorant of nothing for the manner and mea≈øure of a mo≈øt perfect created vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and his will is perfected with the greate≈øt perfections of vertues that are incident to any creature; ≈øo that hee is both in ≈øoule and body far more glorious then any other creature is, or can be, and made Lord of all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. The manhood of Chri≈øt is not the ≈øonne of God by adoption, or creation, but per≈øonall vnion, and ≈øo hath no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Father of ≈øonne-≈øhip, but the ≈øame with the God-head; this exalts him highly in glory, and there is as much difference betwixt the ≈øonne of God and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as betweene a King and his meane≈øt ≈øubiect, and as one Starre differeth from another in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. and the Sunne farre exceeds all the re≈øt: ≈øo in heauen ≈øhall Chri≈øt appeare more glorious then any other Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 60.19. and ≈øhall be as ea≈øily knowne from the re≈øt, as the Sunne is from all other Starres, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His ≈øitting at the right hand of God the Father,</hi> where we haue his <hi>advocation,</hi> and <hi>interce≈ø≈øion</hi> for vs, and need to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no other <hi>Ma≈øter of reque≈øts</hi> in heaven, but one, Ie≈øus Chri≈øt our Mediator. Here good prayers never come weeping home: In him I am ≈øure I ≈øhall receiue, eyther what I aske, or what I ≈øhould aske. I cannot be ≈øo happie, as not to need him, and I know I ≈øhall never be ≈øo mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that he will contemne mee, if I come as a poore ≈øuter, with my petition vnto him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. Furthermore, by Chri≈øts ≈øitting at his Fathers right hand, wee are to vnder≈øtand two things: fir≈øt, the <hi>returne</hi> of the divine nature, as it were (the worke of humiliation being fini≈øhed) to his former glory. Chri≈øt for a time ob≈øcured the excellencie of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.7.8.9. vnder the vaile of our fle≈øh, but now
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3808:142"/>the Curtaine is drawne againe, &amp; the divine nature, which ≈øeemed to ≈øleepe in the humane, is awaked, to worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders openly, for the good of the elect, and even breakes forth as the Sunne doth from vnder a cloud, hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelied all the mi≈øts of his humiliation, Secondly, as there is but a rever≈øion of the divine nature, ≈øo this is an <hi>exaltation</hi> of the humane, to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe that glory and excellency which before it had not, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>and</hi> 110.1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.30.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>and</hi> 8.1.2. <hi>and</hi> 9.24.

               <p>Q. <hi>What benefit redoundeth thereby to vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Vn≈øpeakeable, for while our head is ≈øo highly magnified, and made Lord of all, wee know that he will rule all for the be≈øt, and that no good thing ≈øhall be wanting to them that are his, yea, that our ≈øinnes which wee cannot but commit, whiles the old man dwelleth in vs, ≈øhall not preiudice our happine≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing he ≈øitteth at the right hand of our Father, to be our interce≈ø≈øour and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth and la≈øt degree?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>His glorious returne from heaven to iudgement, both of the quicke and dead,</hi> which is his ≈øecond comming into the world with great glory and maie≈øtie, to the confu≈øion of them that would not haue him rule over them, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakeable good of his owne; for <hi>it is he that iudgeth, and who ≈øhall condemne</hi> them? and hereupon is the full worke of Redemption giuen to the Sonne. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 4.16. <hi>and</hi> 2.

But wee are not to bee di≈ømayed, ≈øeeing God hath made the militant e≈øtate of the Church a degree vnto the triumphant.

This Church con≈øi≈øts onely of men, not as yet freed from the burden of the fle≈øh; and that is the rea≈øon, why the worke of the Lord goes ≈øo ≈ølowly forward, and makes many ≈øit ≈øtill with their hands foulded in their bo≈øomes, and wi≈øh they knew how to be rid of time, and ≈øo become mi≈øerable loo≈øers of good houres, and good parts, and the very hope of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, becau≈øe they will not ≈øtriue with them≈øelues.

               <p>Q. <hi>Is the number of the≈øe alwayes alike?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>No, but ≈øometimes greater, and ≈øometimes le≈ø≈øer,</hi> and its invi≈øible in regard of faith, yet euery faithfull man may know him≈øelfe, and ≈øo may a man that hath the ≈øpirit of di≈øcerning, judge of another to his comfort; for faith in both is to be knowne by his fruits, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>By his care to walke according to the rule of godline≈ø≈øe, he ≈øhall procure a comfortable te≈øtimony to his owns Soule, and confirme others in the way of Religion.</hi> Act. 24.16. 2 Cor. 1.12. Heb. 13.18. Tit. 3.8.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Church militant by it ≈øelfe in the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; it is mingled with tares and chaffe:</hi> and as God left the accur≈øed <hi>Cananites</hi> to be as prickes and thornes to his auncient people: ≈øo ≈øtill will he haue his deare ones to bee exerci≈øed with the wicked of this world, that their graces may more fully be knowne, and them≈øelues wained from the weari≈øome world. Hence it mu≈øt needs be great folly to leaue vi≈øible Congregations, becau≈øe they are pe≈øtered with the prophane of the world; there is no man that will ca≈øt away the gold, or corne, becau≈øe it is mingled with his offall: but will be≈øtow ≈øome labour on the fanne, fire, or furnace. God hath left meanes to purge his Church of prophane per≈øons, though he will haue ≈øome tares to try his Children, and keepe them in awe of his maie≈øtie, nay, make them labour the more to proue their election. If all were good, who would feare to goe to hell? But ≈øeeing we may be Chri≈øtians, and not elect, it will make vs more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ≈øtudie for true holine≈ø≈øe. And knowing that many ≈øhall be damned with the water of Bapti≈øme in their faces, and Church in their mouthes, It will teach Gods Saints in ≈øpite of all hypocri≈øie, <hi>to worke out their ≈øalvation with feare and trembling.</hi> Phil. 2.12. Our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour out of the very feares of damnation, hath fetched the ≈øafe≈øt ≈øecuritie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3808:147"/>of ≈øalvation; oh that we could out of this ≈øecuritie, as ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fetch the feare of his maie≈øtie. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.24.25.47. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.11.12.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the≈øe tares and chaffe?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Into Congregations, as great Armies into le≈ø≈øer bands.</hi> It is impo≈ø≈øible for all to heare one Pa≈øtor, and therefore mu≈øt the governed be ranked vnder diver≈øe teachers, that all may heare and learne. 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.12.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is here to be con≈øidered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The government of the Congregations, which is an order of ruling and obeying in the outward communion of the Saints.</hi> Our ≈øanctification is not wrought all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and the Churches mu≈øt beget children vnto God; and therefore there mu≈øt be an holy ordering of the people to bring this worke to pa≈ø≈øe. Againe, a law is nece≈ø≈øary to keepe corruption vnder, and if there were no power to re≈øtraine evils, this field of God would runne all into thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles. This worke mu≈øt be continuall, or el≈øe grace ≈øpeedeth not. Like as the body from a ≈øetled and habituall di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, mu≈øt be recovered by long dyets; and ≈øo much the rather, for that none can intermit this care without relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes: ≈øo in regard of our old Apo≈øta≈øie, to keepe the heart in vre with God, is the highe≈øt taske of a Chri≈øtian. Good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not frequent: but aboue all the con≈øtancy of a good di≈øpo≈øition is mo≈øt rare and hard. God knowing this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3808:148"/>leaues his Church an order of policy to keepe vnder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and advance grace. And it were an happy thing, if Gods Mini≈øters could be as happy as Trade≈ømen; for a Carpenter in the morning ≈øhall finde his worke as he left it the evening before: but Gods Mini≈øters are often to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe, and like Wyer-drawers are faine to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by going backward.

The≈øe are called Gods right foote, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.2. and are to lead the way.

If <hi>Admonition</hi> would not prevaile with the offender, then proceeded the Governours to <hi>≈øu≈øpen≈øion,</hi> and ≈øo did bind the delinquent from comming to the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and if this <hi>≈øu≈øpen≈øion</hi> prevailed not, then followed the <hi>excommunication</hi> of him, and it was al≈øo either the greater, or the le≈ø≈øer; the Church ≈øtill v≈øing moderation; fir≈øt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the le≈ø≈øer was v≈øed, whiles there was any hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the party offending, then the greater, when his ca≈øe was de≈øperate. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>A receiuing againe of the offender into the Church vpon his true repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.6.10. God would not haue them to peri≈øh that repent of their former evils, but to be comforted of their brethren, lea≈øt over much ≈øorrow ≈øhould ≈øwallow them vp. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.11. In ≈øchooles it is nece≈ø≈øary, not onely that precepts be taught, but that the practi≈øe of them be vrged, and the diligent incouraged: ≈øo in the Church it is needfull that men be not onely in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but pre≈ø≈øed and ≈øtrained to a holy life; for, <hi>not the hearers of the law, but the doors ≈øhall be ≈øaued.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two; <hi>The principall, and the mini≈øteriall.</hi> This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ≈øpirituall, and concernes the Soule, and therefore
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3808:149"/>there mu≈øt be a teaching of the heart as well as the eare; here is need of in≈øpiration with in≈øtruction. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>and</hi> 143.10.11. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who are the principall Governours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Father, the Sonne, and the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> The father is the chiefe agent in the Church; for, <hi>no man commeth to the Sonne, except the Father draw him.</hi> Ioh. 6.44. And <hi>none can come vnto the Father, but by the Sonne</hi> Ioh. 14.16. <hi>Neither can any ≈øay that Ie≈øus is his Lord, but by the Spirit.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. or that he is Gods child by free adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. The Church is one with Chri≈øt, as he is one with his Father. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.21.22.23. not in nature, but in the worke of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the Mini≈øters?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Such as are appointed of the principall to be labourers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them in this worke,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. They are called vnder-rowers. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.2. becau≈øe vnder Chri≈øt the Ma≈øter Pilote, they helpe forward the ≈øhip of the Church, towards the haven of heaven. Men that are ≈øubiect to the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øions with vs, are fitte≈øt to deale for vs. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.17. Thus we ≈øee how God is alone in the principall worke, and principall in the mini≈øteriall. And though he parts labour with his ≈øervants, yet not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the labourer, if he haue his hire, his penny: men doe not v≈øe to devide their ground with the plow man, or their hou≈øe with the Ma≈øon. <hi>He that hath the Bride, is the Bridegroome.</hi> Ioh. 3.29. ≈øo is not he <hi>that prepareth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenteth her.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. ≈øo is not <hi>he that ≈øtandeth by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to heare the Bridegroomes voyce.</hi> All the Apo≈øtles call them≈øelues ≈øervants, not Lords of Gods inheritance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> as a ≈øervant in his Lords hou≈øe, Chri≈øt as the ≈øonne over his owne hou≈øe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5.6. Church-men are the Churches, and not the Church theirs, that the Church with them, may bee Chri≈øts, and hee Gods.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are the Mini≈øters devided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are either ordinary, or extraordinary.</hi> Such were
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3808:149"/>the times wherein the Church had need of extraordinary teaching, that the truth of Religion might depend vpon God, and not the devices of men; and here the Lord had re≈øpect vnto his Maie≈øtie and excellencie; and therefore did immediately communicate him≈øelfe with a few, lea≈øt over-much familiaritie ≈øhould breed contempt, both of him≈øelfe, and his ordinances. No Prince will ≈øpeake to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, but keepe ≈øtate with his ≈øubiects, that they may reverence him the more. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What were the extraordinary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Such as were immediately called of God.</hi> All arts are the wi≈øedome of God, and by creation might bee read in the creatures; but this art of Divinitie by ≈øin is blotted out, and therefore is to bee learned by immediate revelation. Hence God extraordinarily calleth ≈øome, and reveales his will to them, that they may reveale it to others. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.15.16. And this God hath done many wayes, generally, either externally, or internally. Externally by voyce, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vi≈øion. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. or by both together, Chri≈øt for a time a≈ø≈øuming the ≈øhape of men and Angels. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.9.13.17.33. <hi>and</hi> 19.2. Internally, either awaking by in≈øpiration, or ≈øleeping by inward dreames and vi≈øions. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.12.13. &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 2.12.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4.17. Sleepe reacheth not to the rea≈øonable Soule, and God may conferre with man, when both his internall and externall ≈øen≈øes are loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp. He is able to informe the Soule immediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all v≈øe of the body, and by a divine vi≈øion let man ≈øee his will, though his rea≈øon was never informed thereof by his eare, or any outward word. So God can informe the inward ≈øen≈øes without the outward, and by a dreame let a man ≈øee that which was never within the ≈øuppo≈øition of any ≈øen≈øe. So God can ≈øhew vnto the outward ≈øen≈øes, obiects without naturall light, or colour. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.12. He ≈øaw and heard in an exta≈øie. His eye and his eare were ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually taken vp with revelations; not as the Prophets of the wicked Spirit, when they are ≈øaid to be <hi>Deo pleni,</hi> full of God, behauing them≈øelues like mad-men: but quiet and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3808:150"/>calme, vnder≈øtanding well what they did, God fir≈øt certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their vnder≈øtandings, after their wills, and ≈øo incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to ≈øpeake and liue accordingly; the other knew not what they ≈øaid, as being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the Spirit of darkene≈ø≈øe. And this extraordinary revelation, ≈øhews the immortalitie of the ≈øoule, being able to conferre with God even without the body. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. Wee receiue all our knowledge by our outward ≈øen≈øes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. which conuey things to the inward, and they informe our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon: but God can invert the order, and beginne fir≈øt with our rea≈øon, and by that informe our inward ≈øen≈øes in dreames, and then by them our outward, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the ordinary Governours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Such as are called by the Church,</hi> where there is try all of their gifts, election of their per≈øons, and con≈øecration of them in office. The two fir≈øt were ≈øupplied by the third in all tho≈øe whom the Apo≈øtles ordained; for they by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of hands gaue gifts, and therefore ≈øuch were not tryed by the learned, ≈øeeing they had no gifts for ≈øuch cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, before hands were impo≈øed by the Apo≈øtles. Hence it followes, that the new Te≈øtament ≈øpeaking of no other con≈øecration of Mini≈øters, but by the Apo≈øtles, ≈øpeakes nothing of examinations, or elections. Men then had not ordinary gifts; for they receiued them together with other ornaments, by the hands of the Apo≈øtles: that place <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. is abu≈øed, even again≈øt Grammaticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, by tho≈øe that would draw it to election before ordination, and that by the ≈øuffragies of the people; for the Nominatiue ca≈øe to the Verbe, mu≈øt needs be <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> they therefore and not the people were agents in that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and made Mini≈øters of ≈øuch as they found fit for gifts, whom God with an ordinary calling, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily gifted. Wee reade <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6.7. of 12. made Mini≈øters, which before had not heard, whether there was an holy Gho≈øt, yea, or no: who≈øe power immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they felt, after <hi>Paul</hi> had impo≈øed his hands. So that wee may ≈øafely conclude, that ordination is more e≈ø≈øentiall to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3808:150"/>mini≈øtry, then popular election: and yet in after-times the people were not reiected, for the liking, or di≈øliking of their Pa≈øtours, vntill they became factious, and patrons of ≈øchi≈ømes, or at lea≈øt-wi≈øe abetters of the wor≈øe, and ≈øo made them≈øelues vnworthy of their voyces. I would faine know of any ≈øtrict defender of the peoples choice, whether it were better in point of ≈øchi≈øme, or here≈øie, to leaue them to their owne libertie, or to haue them re≈øtrained? If they be left in ≈øuch ea≈øes to them≈øelues, then ≈øhall the Church of God be de≈øtroyed. As for example, in the times of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øme,</hi> whiles the people had libertie, they would choo≈øe no Pa≈øtours but Arians. It ≈øhall ever be ob≈øerved, that in ≈øid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and factious divi≈øions, the wor≈øt are for the mo≈øt part ≈øtronge≈øt, &amp;c. So that election is to be moderated by the di≈øcretion of the civill Magi≈øtrate, or faithfull Pa≈øtours. But ordination and con≈øecration hath ≈øtill gone in his cour≈øe, and Mini≈øters are to make Mini≈øters, and not the people. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. Some are called immediately <hi>of God, and by God,</hi> as Apo≈øtles, ≈øome <hi>of God by man,</hi> as, <hi>Timothie, Titus, &amp;c.</hi> Some of men, and by men, as the Prophets of Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øts, and therefore none of Gods. This is the Tenent of truth, that the fir≈øt cour≈øe of Mini≈øtry hath ever bin extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, the ≈øecond hath ever gone on in an order, as from one government to another, and never hath Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry begun at the people. We deny not that we are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters by Rome, but we affirme, wee are not the Mini≈øters of Rome. Wee are of God by them; and they may as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in≈øtruments of our Mini≈øtery, as of our Bapti≈øme. For as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20. the <hi>Iewes</hi> did beget children vnto God, but con≈øecrate them to <hi>Molech:</hi> ≈øo Papi≈øts may beget both a people, and Pa≈øtor for God; but till they ≈øeparate, they are both con≈øecrated vnto Antichri≈øt. And here let all take notice, how Separati≈øts gnaw vpon this bone, and ≈øucke in nothing but the bloud of their owne iawes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What were the Governed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>All tho≈øe in the Congregations, which were ≈øubiected to their lawfull Pa≈øters,</hi> Act. 20.28. 1 The≈ø≈ø. 5.12. Heb. 13.7.17.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3808:151"/>It is for <hi>Korah,</hi> and his confederates to ri≈øe vp again≈øt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> becau≈øe they are lift vp aboue the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Of how many ought a Congregation to con≈øi≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Of ≈øo many as may conveniently meete together in one place, for the publicke exerci≈øes of Religion.</hi> The ≈øeverall portions are left to the di≈øcretion of our Governors, and ≈øo far forth a Pari≈øh is humane: yet the Congregation it ≈øelfe is Gods ordinance, who would haue it gouerned, according to his owne lawes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. The flocke is Chri≈øts, the fold is le≈ø≈øer or greater, as the Governours judge it fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if ≈øome members of more Congregations meete together, to con≈øult of ≈øome matters?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Then it is called a Councell;</hi> for ≈øingle Congregations are the weake≈øt parts of the Church, and therefore haue need of neighbour helpe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. The Separation teach, that euery Congregation is ab≈øolute in it ≈øelfe, and that a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembling of Councels is voluntary, &amp;c. which if it be true, then the guiltie, or infected Congregation cannot be cited to appeare. <hi>Iudicium redditur in invitum,</hi> for <hi>pars rea,</hi> is in law <hi>pars fugiens,</hi> the party pre≈øumed to come thither again≈øt his will. &amp;c. If then councels be lawfull, there mu≈øt needs be a ≈øubordination of Churches. In the time of <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> Pa≈øtours were called a great way from their charge, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dyed in their travell; and many in their ab≈øence found much hurt done at their returne to their flocke, whereupon order was taken for a more convenient calling of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. They had foure <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> then vnder euery <hi>Patriarke</hi> diver≈øe Provinces, which had an <hi>Archbi≈øhop</hi> ≈øet over ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Dioce≈ø≈øes, euery of which had a <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> ouer it, and the≈øe vnder the Emperour might call councels. If the errour, or ≈øchi≈øme fell out within the Dioce≈ø≈øe, then might the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øan call a councell, and if the error could be there ended and healed, it went no further; if not, then the Province was a≈ø≈øembled by the Arch-bi≈øhop: If yet the error had ≈øo ≈øpred it ≈øelfe that the Province was too weak to conclude,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3808:151"/>the greater number being infected, then did the Patriarch call diver≈øe Provinces; and if there it could not be ended, then came it to an vniver≈øall Councell, &amp;c. And by the≈øe meanes was the Church wonderfully ea≈øed of hard &amp; long travels. This was holy and good; But this excellent order was di≈øturbed by the Patriarke in the We≈øt, who≈øe inva≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tyranny long haue, and ≈øtill doe tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, both of the Church and State. Wee are free from this We≈øterne Patriarke, not onely by rea≈øon of his intolerable tyranny, but al≈øo becau≈øe the di≈ø≈øolution of the Empire, is the di≈ø≈øolution of the Patriarkes. And euery Chri≈øtian Prince is ab≈øolute in him≈øelfe to call by his owne Arch-bi≈øhops, or Bi≈øhops councels as he plea≈øeth. And it is rebellion to the Prince, not to come when he ≈øummons the guiltie to appeare. A gaine, if this authoritie were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued, then would the power re≈øide in the order of the ≈øpirituall Governours, as they were left by the Apo≈øtles. And ≈øo councels could not be called vniver≈øall, nationall, provinciall Dioce≈ø≈øan; for, as tyrants prohibite the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke exerci≈øes of Religion, ≈øo the publicke congregating of Councels. And here let me ≈øling this ≈øtone into the bra≈øen foreheads of our adver≈øaries, which in their ≈øhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe challenges, dare tell the world, wee are an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Church. What one iot of authoritie doe we borrow from the Pope? Is not all juri≈ødiction and power in the Prince, and for exerci≈øe in the Bi≈øhops?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What further di≈øtinction is there of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Be≈øides the <hi>vi≈øibilitie,</hi> or <hi>invi≈øibilitie. Puritie,</hi> or <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> of Congregations and Churches. It is di≈øtingui≈øhed by the <hi>times</hi> thereof, as it was yet in a <hi>familie,</hi> or <hi>people.</hi> The Church was an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the hatching, till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time; In ≈øwathing bands till <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> In child-hood till Chri≈øt; a man in Chri≈øt, and ≈øhall be a man full growne in glory. It did long ≈øticke betweene the knees, and want power to come into the light; but at length by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of times, comes to perfection of parts and degrees. As man is an epitome of the world, ≈øo is euery Chri≈øtian an abridgement
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3808:152"/>of the Church; be≈øt at his la≈øt. Like the fea≈øt of <hi>Cana,</hi> where the be≈øt wine was re≈øerved to the end. Wee mu≈øt ever be <hi>growing from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength,</hi> for it is a fearefull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to goe backward, how can he be rich that growes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day poorer? Can he ever reach the goale, that goes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day a ≈øtep backe from it? Alas then, how ≈øhall he ever reach the goale of glory, that runnes euery day a ≈øtep back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in grace? He that is wor≈øe euery day, can never be at his be≈øt. True grace is contrary to nature, for it will bee ≈øtronge≈øt at la≈øt. Sure I am, in regard of time, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church increa≈øeth in number and grace, yet vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congregations are ≈øoyled with age, and grow wor≈øe by the tracts of time. Families, a nation, &amp; now the world growes decrepit, in re≈øpect of their liuely beginnings. Primitiue times were not pe≈øtered with tho≈øe di≈øea≈øes that are now growne vpon the Church, and vnder which it groaneth. Like <hi>Ezekias</hi> Sunne wee are gone backe many degrees in the diall of perfection, and yet the Catholicke Church like the <hi>Sunne</hi> till noone, will ever be ri≈øing. Fie on tho≈øe Apo≈øtates, who≈øe beginnings, like <hi>Neroes</hi> fir≈øt fiue yeares, are full of hope and peace, and then decline into villany. Hypocrites, like the fir≈øt moneth of a new ≈øervant, out-goe all, but like Hor≈øe-cour≈øers Iades ≈øoone giue in and tyre. Who≈øe age is like vnto the foure ages of the world; fir≈øt gold, at la≈øt iron. Pictures of zeale, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, from a precious head, they fall to ba≈øe feete. The≈øe be the true hot-≈øpurs, that will ≈øoone runne them≈øelues out of breath. But we may well ≈øay ≈øuch were never right bred; for Gods Church gaines perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with time. Therefore all ≈øuch as proue falling Starres, never were ought but Meteors. True Saints never loo≈øe light, or motion: Spirituall motion may be violent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of nature, and perpetuall in re≈øpect of grace. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 60.8. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Vntill the time of Mo≈øes;</hi> ≈øo long God had the fir≈øt borne for his Prie≈øts, and euery head of the familie was not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3808:152"/>onely Ma≈øter, but Mini≈øter, &amp;c. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.12.

               <p>Q. <hi>Who were the Governours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The extraordinary were the Patriarches.</hi> Which were Prophets; for the rule of Religion was alwayes to bee the ≈øame in the Church, though God did diver≈øely admini≈øter it. Wee denie not but that the word of God may be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but our difference is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the kind of the di≈øtinction and di≈øtribution; whether the word be ≈øo devided into his e≈ø≈øentiall parts, or into two di≈øtinct manners of deliverance? Wee ≈øay the word is e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentially the ≈øame, whether it be ≈øpoken or written, and that writing &amp; ≈øpeaking are but two accidents of the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance. Furthermore, wee ≈øay that the word delivered by tradition, was as well in≈øpired, as when afterward it plea≈øed God to reveale his will by Scriptures. Tradition was fitter for a family, then a Bible; becau≈øe dead letters had beene of no validitie to a weake Church. Wee feed the childe with the ≈øpoone, and dare not tru≈øt him with the knife. Spoone-meat was fit for families, though afterwards God would haue all his people v≈øe the knife, and learne to cut their owne meate; and therefore he gaue the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ≈øome Scriptures to feed on. And here appeares the wrong, Papi≈øts offer to the Churches of the Go≈øpell, who re≈øtraine them from Bibles, as if they were ≈øtill in the infancie, &amp;c. To conclude, God never taught by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the deliverers were extraordinarily in≈øpired; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the re≈øt were no further to be tru≈øted or beleeued, then they had receiued their doctrines from the Patriarkes, and extraordinary Prophets. And if the Pope could make vs beleeue, he had the≈øe in≈øpirations, wee ≈øhould no more doubt of his Oracles, then we doe of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues. <hi>The ordinary Governours were the heads, and eldest ≈øonnes of the families, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 4.26. and 18.19.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>The re≈øidue of the familie;</hi> And here wee may learne, what was the mo≈øt auncient kind of teaching, to wit, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing,</hi> or familie teaching; and it is a ≈øhame to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, when he ≈øuffers his familie to liue in ignorance and blindne≈ø≈øe.

               <p>Q. <hi>How was the Church in a People?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>As it did con≈øi≈øt of many families, and had the bounds thereof exceedingly inlarged from the dayes of Mo≈øes.</hi> Vntill his time God had but a familie or two to wor≈øhip him.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is here to be con≈øidered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The writing of the rule of Religion,</hi> which was done by ≈øuch extraordinary Governours, as God had fitted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired by his holy Spirit thereunto, for the edification of his Church. For even then God had both extraordinary and ordinary teachers: now wee haue the rule completely delivered in writing, and therefore need not any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Governours in the Church. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.21.

                  <hi>A.</hi> According to the nece≈ø≈øitie of the Church, diver≈øely, and at ≈øundry times, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. God increa≈øed the dyet of his Church, as he ≈øaw it was fit to beare it.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What are the Bookes called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For the matter contained, The word of God; for the manner of Record, The Scriptures, by an excellencie of phra≈øe, as the mo≈øt worthy writings that ever ≈øaw the light, and being compiled into one volume, are called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or many little Bookes, vnited in one body: ≈øo that both worke and writing, carry away the names of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, and Bookes, as mo≈øt, admirable for v≈øe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16.17.

               <p>Q. <hi>How are the≈øe to be con≈øidered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As they are either in the originall tongues, or in the Tran≈ølations; in the pure≈øt fountaines, or the derived ≈øtreames and conduits. In the Originalls, not onely the matter (which is the Divinitie, Dogmaticall, Hi≈øtoricall, &amp;c.) but al≈øo the meanes of inferring, (which is the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke) the manner of expre≈ø≈øing, and enforcing (which is the Grammar and Rhetorique) are all immediately in≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All ≈øcripture is in≈øpired from God.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.21. <hi>The holy mon of God ≈øpake as they were moued by the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> In the tran≈ølations, the ≈øubiect matter, or ≈øub≈øtance of Theologie, is equally in≈øpired, though mediately. The Logicall coherence al≈øo and con≈øequence of argument, retaineth the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øitie of illation, becau≈øe it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not vpon diver≈øitie of Languages, but communitie of notions. But as for the proprietie of Grammar, and vigor of Rhetorique, there mu≈øt needs be ≈øome abatement and embatement. Fir≈øt, and principally, becau≈øe the skill and diligence herein v≈øed by Tran≈ølators, is not divine or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired, but meerely humane at the be≈øt, and in tryall proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be lyable to much latitude, ≈øometime more, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time le≈ø≈øe. Secondly, for that many emphaticall words, and rigorous figures, both of Grammar and Rhetorique, proper to the originall Tongues (≈øuch as are e≈øpecially deriuatiues, agnominations, proverbes, &amp;c.) cannot to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3808:154"/>the life be expre≈ø≈øed in other Languages. Thirdly, and la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becau≈øe in vulgar Languages, there is ≈øuch mutabilitie and change of fa≈øhions (almo≈øt as much as in apparell) that after a few yeares, we ≈øcarce vnder≈øtand what our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meant in ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages of the Scripture in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue, much le≈ø≈øe in the Latine, which in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is ≈øo pe≈øtered with Barbari≈ømes in ≈øtile (be≈øide defects in notion) that not onely S. <hi>Hierome</hi> would write invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, if he ≈øhould ≈øee ≈øuch a brat layd at his dore, but <hi>Pri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> him≈øelfe would call for the <hi>ferula.</hi> It was therefore a very pious and laudable intention in our learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Soueraigne, to appoint all our Engli≈øh Tran≈ølati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture to be receiued, and the be≈øt of them corrected by neere≈øt reduction to the originals, and to the proprieties of our Language.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How in the originall Tongues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>As they are in the tongue, wherein the Spirit did indite them,</hi> and they are of them≈øelues to be receiued without all exception, as being Canonicall, and hauing their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, primarily, from the ≈øpirit, and by them≈øelues, ≈øecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, from the Church. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>and</hi> 2 Ephi≈øt. 3. chap. ver. 16. The Church is the pillar, on which the truth mu≈øt hang to be ≈øhewed to others, or the ground on which it re≈øteth it ≈øelfe, finding little ≈øtay el≈øe-where. Next to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony of the Spirit, and word it ≈øelfe, wee are to admit the Churches te≈øtimony.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth the Scripture containe the whole body of Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It doth mo≈øt fully and plainely</hi> and therefore there is no need of vnwritten verities, or Popi≈øh Traditions. It is the rule of all faith, and controver≈øies of faith. It is the ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, or the Kings beame, by which wee are to try all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that is tendred to vs. Wee are not to goe by the common beame of cu≈øtome and opinion, but by the≈øe ballances of Gods ≈øanctuary, not ≈øuffering a drams waight to be iniected, that may incline the≈øe golden ≈øcoales as we plea≈øe. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 8.20. When the law was written, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls both him≈øelfe and the people to it for tryall, when he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3808:154"/>had written his fiue bookes, the Prophets that followed were content to haue their ≈øayings brought to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> law for tryall: Chri≈øt him≈øelfe never refu≈øed any tryall by the law and Prophets, yea, ever and anone is hee appealing vnto them for proofe of his owne doctrine; and ≈øo all the A po≈øtles did tread in their ma≈øters ≈øteps, onely the man of ≈øinne will not indure any ≈øuch tribunall, he will iudge all, and be iudged by none.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But they ≈øeeme not to be ≈øo plaine and per≈øpicuous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, in them≈øelues they are evident enough, concerning things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation,</hi> and if at any time they ≈øeeme hard, it is by rea≈øon of the weakene≈ø≈øe of our vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.6. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 25.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. We mu≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ob≈øcure pa≈ø≈øages, pray to God, and conferre one place with another, and con≈øider duely the cirum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of the places, and wee ≈øhall find the true meaning; if not, God will pardon our ignorance, and require no more of vs, then him≈øelfe giueth, wee v≈øing his meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ≈øen≈øe is to be giuen of Scriptures, and whence mu≈øt it be taken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Scriptures haue euer one literall ≈øen≈øe and meaning,</hi> and that which mu≈øt be fetched from them≈øelues. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. It is of no private interpretation, or as man will haue it, but it mu≈øt be expounded as it was ≈øpoken. And the ≈øame mouth mu≈øt be both the maker and interpreter, that is, the holy Gho≈øt. No man knowes Grammar but by Grammar, neither can wee ≈øee the Sunne without the Sunne; ≈øo, no man can expound Scripture, but by Scripture. There is the ≈øame Art, both in the compo≈øition and re≈øolution; as there is the ≈øame way in going backward and forward. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rightly vnder≈øtood in our actions, are as the heart in the body, for conveying life to all the parts, or as a dram of Muske, perfuming the whole box of oyntment. This is that godline≈ø≈øe which breedeth an heedfulne≈ø≈øe in all our wayes and actions. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Q. <hi>How are they to be con≈øidered as tran≈ølated?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Howbeit the Scriptures as they be tran≈ølated be not ≈øo <hi>authenticall,</hi> and <hi>canonicall,</hi> as the originalls, yet ought they to be read publickely and privately of all, and to bee receiued as the word of God. Onely this mu≈øt be the care of the learned, that as much as lies in them they labour, that the <hi>apographicall</hi> tran≈ølations, or tran≈ø≈øcriptions an≈øwere the <hi>autographicall,</hi> and primary originals. And if there be any mi≈ø-taking, they mu≈øt ever be reformed by the fountaines them≈øelues. The Hebrewes and Greekes drinke both of the well-head, pure tran≈ølations of the Streames, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in their authenticall, <hi>Ierome</hi> of the very puddles. Well may I ≈øay of <hi>Trent</hi> fathers, as that Chian ≈øervant, of his Ma≈øter (which ≈øold his wine, and dranke the lees) whiles they had good, they ≈øought for that which was nought, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how ≈øhall the ignorant in the originals doe in this ca≈øe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>They mu≈øt referre them≈øelues to their faithfull and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Pa≈øtours, whom God ≈øhall ≈øtirre vp for the faithfull teaching of his people.</hi> And the Spirit of God which dwelleth in tho≈øe that are his, will inable them to di≈øcerne even in tran≈ølations, betweene truth and fal≈øhood: ≈øo that if any errour ≈øhould be; if they attend the meanes ordained of God, they ≈øhall not want information. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.4. if they confider how things are written from point to point, they ≈øhall come to a certaintie of Scripture. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 102.18.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Had the Church be≈øide the≈øe extraordinary teachers, no other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, there were al≈øo ordinary teachers, that euery congregation might be ≈øupplied with able men to in≈øtruct them, and the≈øe were to depend vpon the extraordinary, and ≈øo farre to be heard, as they agreed with their words, or writings. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.15.16. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> receiues from God, and <hi>Aaron</hi> from <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> &amp;c. In all points of Religion, we mu≈øt depend vpon God, in prayers, if he powre not vpon vs, we cannot powre out vnto him. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:3808:155"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How was the Church in a people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Fir≈øt, in the peculiar people of I≈ørael; ≈øecondly, among all people.</hi> The Church did grow from a dome≈øticall ≈øocietie, to a nationall, and from a nation, to all nations. I haue ≈øeene great Ryvers, which at their fir≈øt ri≈øing out of ≈øome hilles ≈øide, might be covered with a Bu≈øhell; which after many miles, fill a very broad channell, and drawing neere to the Sea, doe even make a little Sea in their own bankes: ≈øo the Church had but a ≈ømall beginning, which is now growne Catholicke over all the world. Grace is compared to the wind, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. which at the fir≈øt ri≈øing, is as a little vapour from the cranies of the earth, and pa≈ø≈øing forward about the earth, the further it goeth, the more blu≈øtering and violent it waxeth. So ought the Church, and euery member of it to be daily increa≈øing, and thriuing in grace. It was the Devils devi≈øe, to bring that ≈ølaunder vpon care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holine≈ø≈øe; <hi>A yong Saint, an old Devill.</hi> I beleeue that ≈øometimes yong Devils may turne old Saints; never the contrary; for true Saints in youth, will proue Angels in age. Let vs therefore ≈øtriue to be ever good, and thinke with our ≈øelues, ≈øurely, if wee be not be≈øt at la≈øt, wee may iu≈øtly feare, wee were never good at all. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.3.4.5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What was this people of I≈ørael?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>A peculiar people, whom the Lord cho≈øe to him≈øelfe, of whom Chri≈øt was to come, according to the fle≈øh:</hi> and becau≈øe he was yet to come, they had both the <hi>Mo≈ø≈øias</hi> promi≈øed them, and by many types and ceremonies ≈øhadowed out vnto them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6.7.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.2. <hi>and</hi> 9.4.5. O if God in the≈øe things ≈øet his loue vpon them, how loues hee vs, to whom the very graces them≈øelues haue appeared? <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What were the Congregations called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Although God would haue all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ≈øacrifice in one place; yet would he haue praying and preaching in euery Towne &amp; Citie; and mother townes had many Synagogues. <hi>Abel</hi> is called a mother Citie,

               <p>Q. <hi>Who were the extraordinary Governours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Prophets;</hi> of whom ≈øome did write the bookes of the old Te≈øtament in the Hebrew tongue, which are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thirtie nine, all which by our Sauiour Chri≈øt, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Math. 11.13. &amp; 22.40. or may be devided into <hi>Prie≈øtly, Princely,</hi> and <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> bokes, in regard of Chri≈øt, which is the ≈øubiect of them all: or according to the mo≈øt v≈øuall di≈øtribution; fir≈øt, the bookes of the law, written by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and they are fiue, <hi>Gene≈øis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi> Secondly, the foure fir≈øt Prophets, as <hi>Io≈øhua, Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> two bookes of <hi>Samuel</hi> and two bookes of the <hi>Kings;</hi> and the foure latter Prophets, to wit, the three great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>I≈øa: Ier: Ezek:</hi> and the twelue le≈ø≈øer, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, they comprehend all in one booke, <hi>Ho≈ø: Ioel, Amos, Obed: Ion: Mic: Nah: Hab: Zeph: Hag: Zech: Mal:</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the nine others, they call <hi>Cetubhim,</hi> or writings, by an excellencie, and they are, <hi>Iob, P≈øalmes, Prov: Eccl: Can: Dan: Chron:</hi> 2. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. <hi>He≈øter.</hi> Our Sauiour Chri≈øt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. makes a tripartite divi≈øion of the old Te≈øtament into <hi>Law, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>P≈øalmes,</hi> and makes him≈øelfe the ≈øubiect of them all. The law was Morall, Ceremoniall, and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall. And all were types of Chri≈øt. The Morall, which is for in≈øtruction, did prefigure Chri≈øt as our Prophet; the Ceremoniall, which was for expiation, did ≈øhadow him as our Prie≈øt; the Iudiciall, which was for Government, as King. The Prophets that foretold Chri≈øt, were ≈øome of them Kings &amp; Governours, ≈øome Prie≈øts, and ≈øome pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets. The <hi>P≈øalmes</hi> are mixed of all three, full of prayers, prophecies, and ≈øcepters, &amp;c. There is a latter di≈øtribution ob≈øerued by Interpreters, and that is <hi>quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite,</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:3808:156"/>as into bookes <hi>Legall, Hi≈øtoricall, Poeticall,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall.</hi> The Legall, are the fiue bookes of <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> Hi≈øtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the twelue following to <hi>Iob.</hi> Poeticall, the ≈øix follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the beginning of <hi>Iob</hi> to <hi>E≈øay.</hi> Propheticall, the three great Prophets, with the twelue le≈ø≈øer, and <hi>Daniel.</hi> The <hi>Apocrypha</hi> is ≈øhut out of the di≈øtribution, both by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and our Saviour, and therefore is not of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the bookes we haue mentioned. God made the <hi>Iewes</hi> faithfull regi≈øters of the old Te≈øtament; and they were ≈øo curious, lea≈øt a letter ≈øhould be lo≈øt, that they kept them by count: and therefore would never haue beene ≈øo negligent in the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> writing if ever they had beene committed of God vnto them, by their extraordinary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.

               <p>Q. <hi>Who were the extraordinary Governours of this Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Iohn Bapti≈øt, the forerunner of Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt him≈øelfe, his Apo≈øtles, ≈øeventie Di≈øciples, Evangeli≈øts, and Prophets;</hi> whereof ≈øome did write the bookes of the new Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Greeke tongue; which are either Hi≈øtoricall, as the <hi>Go≈øpells</hi> of <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe excellent <hi>Epi≈øtles,</hi> as of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> 2. <hi>Galathians, Ephe≈øians, Philippians, Colo≈ø≈øians, The≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> 2. <hi>Titus, Philomon, Hebrewes,</hi> Epi≈øtle of <hi>Iames,</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>Iude;</hi> or la≈øtly, the Propheticall booke of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who were the ordinary Governours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The Doctors and Pa≈øtours. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. which may be di≈øtributed into <hi>Bi≈øhops, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> As for the fir≈øt, if time and place be accidents of a calling, and the very e≈ø≈øence lie in relation betwixt the <hi>caller</hi> and the <hi>called. Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were ordinary teachers; for to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Governour, an extraordinary caller is required. It cannot be denied, but that both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did a long time wait vpon the Apo≈øtles, and were ≈øent from place to place, though ≈øetled at the la≈øt. If going from place to place make an <hi>Euangeli≈øt,</hi> then they were both of them Evangeli≈øts: but I beleeue all the Pa≈øtours and Doctours of the Church were at the Apo≈øtles command, and ≈øent too and fro as there was need. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10.12.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wee heare of <hi>Cre≈øcens, Titus, Tychicus, Trophimus,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe wayes by the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it is not enough from the place, to ≈øay, ≈øuch a one was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeli≈øt, except it be further prooued, that he had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary calling. That <hi>Timothy</hi> is bidden to <hi>doe the worke of an Euangeli≈øt,</hi> it is a dubious terme, for an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øt,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3808:157"/>is either put for a <hi>writer</hi> of the Go≈øpels, and ≈øo ≈øome Apo≈øtles are Evangeli≈øts; or for an <hi>officer,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øuch as were extraordinarily called to plant Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. but had no power to ordaine them Pa≈øtours, are called Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli≈øts, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.8. And of this ≈øort might be many of the ≈øeventie Di≈øciples: or la≈øtly, for <hi>Preachers;</hi> for the Go≈øpell (with which the name is coniugated) is the obiect of all three. The fir≈øt write it for the edification of the Church, the ≈øecond preach it, and worke miracles, to confirme it for the plantation of the Church; and the third preach it too, for the further watering of that ≈øeed which others haue ≈øowne before them, and in this ≈øen≈øe is <hi>Timothy</hi> bidden to <hi>doe the worke of an Evangeli≈øt,</hi> as the next words expound it, <hi>make thy mini≈øtery fully knowne.</hi> And it is out of doubt, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was called of God by man, which to me is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling. And that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (as Bi≈øhops properly ≈øo called) had a ≈øuperintendencie, and coerciue power of juri≈ødiction over Elders, Mini≈øters, or Preachers it is evident to me out of the≈øe places, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.5.19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.11.13. The Elders are from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, called <hi>Pre≈øbyteri,</hi> which turned into Engli≈øh, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prie≈øts, the mo≈øt current and pa≈ø≈øable title, had not Ma≈ø≈øe-mongers made it infamous, in the eares of ≈øuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as are not acute enough to devide betweene a fit title, and a corrupting abu≈øe. Thus much for the name. As for the office of Elders (taken for Eccle≈øia≈øticall Governours) I find none de≈øcribed, but by ≈øeeding of the flocke, which makes mee conclude, they were all Pa≈øtours. As for that place. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. all the que≈øtion is about the compari≈øon, whether gifts, or offices be compared together. The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hath it thus, <hi>Elders ruling well are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, e≈øpecially, labouring in the word and doctrine:</hi> now it is a rule in the Greeke tongue, that participles are to be turned into rea≈øons of the things they explaine; as <hi>ruling</hi> becau≈øe they rule, and <hi>labouring</hi> becau≈øe they labour, &amp;c. The ≈øen≈øe then may be thus rendred, without all rending of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon. Elders are to be reompenced with honour and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3808:158"/>maintenance; fir≈øt, becau≈øe they rule; ≈øecondly, becau≈øe they preach. Fir≈øt, they goe before their flocke in holy practi≈øe of di≈øcipline, vpon them≈øelues and others; ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they continually pre≈ø≈øe them by precepts in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching. Now that the people may e≈øpecially ≈øee wherein they are to be honoured, it is in this, that they are labourious di≈øpen≈øers and di≈øpo≈øers of heauenly doctrine. Therefore with the Scriptures, I ≈øay that the ordinary tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Governours of the Chri≈øtian Churches, were Pa≈øtours and Doctors, and that copulatiuely, and not ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatiuely, as in Apo≈øtles, Prophets, and Evangeli≈øts.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Church triumphant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The number of all tho≈øe that are applied vnto Chri≈øt by ≈øight.</hi> After faith and ≈øight, followes freedome and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Church con≈øi≈øts of holy Spirits, both Angels and men, the ≈øoules of the Saints departed, are receiued vp into glory, and after the re≈øurrection, the militant Church both in body and ≈øoule ≈øhall be of the Triumphant, in the full fruition of all bli≈ø≈øe and happine≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.23.24. <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.2.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10.16.26. &amp;c. As tho≈øe therefore that haue ta≈øted of ≈øome delicate di≈øh, finde other plaine di≈øhes but vnplea≈øant; ≈øo it fareth with all tho≈øe which haue once ta≈øted of heauenly things, they cannot but contemne the be≈øt worldly plea≈øures. As therefore ≈øome daintie gue≈øt, knowing there is ≈øome plea≈øant fare to come, will re≈øerue his appetite for it: ≈øo mu≈øt not we ≈øuffer our ≈øelues to be cloyed with the cour≈øe dyet of the world, but keepe our de≈øires for the ioyes to come. And if world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings find ≈øo much plea≈øure on earth, as to thinke it worth the account of their heauen; becau≈øe they ≈øee ≈øuch a Sunne to enlighten it, ≈øuch an heauen to wall it about, ≈øuch ≈øweet fruits and flowers to adorne it, ≈øuch varietie of creatures, for the commodious v≈øe of it, and yet onely provided for mortalitie, and chiefely po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the makers enemies: what then mu≈øt heaven needs be, that is provided for God him≈øelfe, and his be≈øt friends? If the out ≈øide be ≈øo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, what ≈øhall be within? How can it be le≈ø≈øe in worth,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3808:158"/>≈øeeing God is aboue his creatures, and Gods friends bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his enemies? I will therefore not onely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but de≈øirous to be di≈ø≈øolved.</p>

                  <hi>Preparation, and the infu≈øion of faith.</hi> Such is the nature of man, that before he can receiue a true iu≈øtifying faith, hee mu≈øt (as it were) be broken in peeces by the law. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.9. The word of God is both the hammer to breake our hard hearts, and a fire to heat, melt, mollifie, and di≈ø≈øolue them into the teares of godly ≈øorrow. A rocke may tremble, and an iron ve≈ø≈øell by violent ≈øtroakes may be broken in peeces, and yet ≈øtill retaine their hardne≈ø≈øe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ≈øweet and plea≈øant fire of grace mu≈øt ≈øoften them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. It is the bloud of the Lambe that mu≈øt melt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> and the Sunne-≈øhine of Gods loue in Chri≈øt, that mu≈øt thaw the ice of our hearts. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. we are to be led from the feare of ≈ølaues, through the feare of penitents, to the feare of ≈øonnes: and indeed one of the≈øe makes way for another; and though perfect loue thru≈øt out feare, yet mu≈øt feare bring in that perfect loue; as a Needle, or Bri≈øtle drawes in the thred after it, or as the potion brings health. The compunction of feare (≈øaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) fits the minde for the compunction of loue. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.11. We are bidden to reioyce in God with trembling. If <hi>Samuel</hi> had not made the people to quake at Gods thunder and raine, hee ≈øhould never haue brought them ≈øo to haue ioyed in the following Sunne-≈øhine. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18.19. &amp;c.

Feare not the thunder, but feare him that ≈øent it. If ever wee will ≈øtoope, the iudgements of God will bring vs on our knees.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the preparation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>A fitting vs for our being in Chri≈øt;</hi> for wee being branches of the wild Oliue, mu≈øt be made ready for our being in the true Oliue, before wee can be grafted into it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5.6.7. The convexe, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowed ≈øide of a ve≈ø≈øell will hold nothing; it mu≈øt be the hollow and depre≈ø≈øed part, that is capable of any liquor. The broken &amp; contrite ≈øpirit makes way for Gods grace. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.17. Sweetly <hi>Bernard,</hi> God poures not the oyle of his mercy, ≈øaue into a broken ve≈ø≈øell; for indeed whole ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, are full ve≈ø≈øels: and ≈øo this precious oyle would runne over, and be ≈øpilt on the ground. Oh, if wee were ≈øo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the varieties of Gods iudgements as wee ought, how ≈øavory would his coun≈øels be? How precious and welcome would his feare be to our trembling hearts? Whereas now our ≈øtubborne ≈øen≈øele≈øne≈ø≈øe fru≈øtrates all the threatnings and executions of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When is this done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. In the acceptable time, and day of ≈øaluation, in the which the Lord plea≈øeth to bring into act his purpo≈øe of ≈øalvation, in gathering his owne out of the world, and that ≈øooner, or later, as it plea≈øeth him Wee may not mend the pace of God, or ≈øpurre on his decree; yet mu≈øt we be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the meanes, vntill God ble≈ø≈øe them for this end. Every man hath power to goe to Church, heare the word, and be pre≈øent at all outward ≈øeruices, and the neglect of this hinders many, in re≈øpect of better ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, though not of Gods decree. Wee therefore are guiltie of our owne time ill husbanded, though God will not worke before his owne day. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What are the parts of this preparation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Fir≈øt, the <hi>cutting</hi> of vs, as it were, from the wild O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue tree. Secondly, a <hi>paring,</hi> and fitting of vs to be put into the true Oliue tree. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. The Gentiles <hi>were cut out of the Oliue tree, which is wild by nature, and contrary to nature grafted into a good Oliue tree, &amp;c.</hi> Wee that grow wild in wickedne≈ø≈øe, want grace to ≈øeeke Chri≈øt, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his vertues, are vnapt to ioyne with him, without a great preparation. Tell the prophane per≈øon in the mid≈øt of all his iollitie and revels, of devotion, pietie, or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and he will turne you off with the <hi>Athenian</hi> que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>What doth this babler ≈øay?</hi> Tell the woman of <hi>Samaria Ioh.</hi> 4. of the water of life, and ≈øhee will mocke at it, till Chri≈øt ≈øit as iudge in her con≈øcience, and pinch her with that clo≈øe imputation of adultery: there is no ≈øowing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. till the hard and clottie fallow ground be ≈øubdued by the Plough: the vnhumbled ≈øinner is as vnfit for Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, as an vnbroken Colt for the ≈øaddle. Our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants cannot be ≈øtayed from their Gallop, till God touch their Soules with ≈øome terrour, ca≈øt their bodies on their beds of ≈øicknes, turne their fooles feathers into kerchiefes, then when they ≈øee their faces grow pale, their eyes ≈øunke in their heads, their hands ≈øhaking, their breath ≈øhort, their fle≈øh con≈øumed, you ≈øhall haue them ea≈øie to be talkt withall, now, or el≈øe never will they learne with old <hi>Eli,</hi> to ≈øay, <hi>≈øpeake Lord, for thy ≈øervants heare.</hi> Thus wee ≈øee it is good ≈øtriking when the iron is hot; there is no fi≈øhing ≈øo good, as in the≈øe troubled waters. Now it is good ≈øtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whom God hath ≈øtricken; for con≈øcience is a nice and ≈øullen thing, and if it be not taken at fit times and moodes, there will be no medling with it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What meane you by this cutting of vs from the wild Oliue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two things; fir≈øt, a <hi>violent pulling</hi> of vs out of the corruption of nature, or a cutting (as it were) by the knife of the law of an vnregenerate man from his ≈øecurity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3808:160"/>he ≈øleepeth, he not ≈øo much as dreaming of any ≈øuch thing. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.70. <hi>Their heart is as fat as grea≈øe: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thy law.</hi> Shewing by the oppo≈øition, that it is onely the leane heart, pined and pinched with ≈øpirituall famine, that can feele any delight in God: nothing more vn≈øavory to a ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe, brawny heart, then Chri≈øts bloud; no more reli≈øh feeles, or findes he in it, then in a dry chip. Nay, he never complaines of his mi≈øery; a man being dead neuer bemoanes the intollerable paines of the Stone, who if hee were aliue, would te≈øtifie his griefe by groanes, for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paine, and gripes he continually feeleth. Secondly, as there is a <hi>violent evul≈øion;</hi> ≈øo as <hi>violent attraction</hi> to Chri≈øt for ea≈øe, man at the fir≈øt plainely refu≈øing it: the hunted bea≈øt flies to his den; the pur≈øued malefactor to the hornes of the Altar, or Citie of Refuge. <hi>Pauls</hi> mi≈øery <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. driues him to Gods mercy; The <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> are driuen into their Chambers by the de≈øtroying Angell; <hi>Balaam</hi> is made to leane backe by the naked ≈øword; <hi>Agur</hi> to run to <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>Vcal,</hi> that is, Chri≈øt. <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.1.2.3. When he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with his owne bruiti≈øhne≈ø≈øe. God mu≈øt let loo≈øe his law, ≈øinne, con≈øcience, and Satan to bait vs, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle hell fires in our Soules, before wee will be driuen to ≈øeeke to Chri≈øt. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> came not out of pri≈øon, without a greater earth-quake, then poore ≈øinners from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans hold, with an heart-quake. How violently did Satan driue <hi>Saul</hi> to per≈øecute; and did not Chri≈øt as violently ≈øend him backe againe by a contrary winde, that blew him off his hor≈øe, &amp; ≈ømote him downe, as dead, to the ground? As <hi>Lot</hi> was driuen out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> with fire and brim≈øtone about his eares; or as the venturous child is terrified from fire &amp; water, the carefull Father holding him by the heeles over both: ≈øo God by the ≈øowre ≈øauce of a guiltie con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, lets the ≈øinner ≈øee what it is to fall to the ≈øweet meat of ≈øinne, and eate thereof vnto ≈øurfeit. <hi>Davids</hi> broken bones, and brui≈øed con≈øcience, will tell him of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in murther and adultery, and what he gaines by his ≈øilence. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.3.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:3808:160"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are wee pared and trimmed for our putting into Chri≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By our humiliation for ≈øinne;</hi> God takes advantage of our feares; for hauing ≈øtopped the way of ≈øinne with feare, he labours to tyre and weary the ≈øinner with ≈øorrow, and according to that golden ≈øentence of that <hi>Samian</hi> wi≈øe man, that bids vs lay weight vpon the loden, lades the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender with his burden, vntill he be weary of it, and could wi≈øh with all his heart, he were rid of it. Oh, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is the fountaine of liuing waters to the cha≈øed Hart, panting, and braying? So how welcome is redemption to the thir≈øtie Con≈øcience, ≈øcorched with the ≈øen≈øe of Gods wrath? The traytor laid on the blocke will be ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough of his Soueraignes mercy in pardoning, and farre more apprehen≈øiue of it, then when he was fir≈øt atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And yet for all this, ≈øinners doe but wilder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in humiliation, except God ≈øtill draw them on vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be ingrafted into Chri≈øt. Humane helps here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile nothing; merriments haue no more power to quiet con≈øcience, then holy-water and charmes to coniure the Devill; Popi≈øh pardons, pilgrimages, ≈øhrifts, whips, are ≈øilly ≈øhifts to ea≈øe the bleeding wounds of ≈øorrowful ≈øoules. He that drinkes water, or leapes into a poole, to coole his fever, fiers him≈øelfe the more, though he feele ≈øome ea≈øe for the pre≈øent: his torment will never cea≈øe till he both find Chri≈øt, and be found of him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.9.10.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is this wrought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. God giueth the ≈øinner to ≈øee by the law his <hi>≈øinne,</hi> and the <hi>puni≈øhment</hi> of it, and that by the detection happily of ≈øome one ≈øinne and that many times none of the greate≈øt, lea≈øt he ≈øhould be pre≈øently ≈øwallowed vp of de≈øpaire; yet by that one makes him ≈øu≈øpect the re≈øt. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19. That one ≈øinne in asking of a King, brought them to confe≈ø≈øe all. Furthermore, the detection of one ≈øinne, and ≈øu≈øpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the re≈øt, with their iu≈øt de≈øert, driues them to compunction, and a pricking of heart, which is greater or le≈ø≈øer, and carries with it diver≈øe Symptomes, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3808:161"/>≈øen≈øible pa≈ø≈øions of griefe. All are not handled alike, ≈øome haue greater fits then others, and are but (as it were) ≈øprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Bapti≈øme, wherein others haue beene dou≈øed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head and eares. Some ≈øip of this cup, others drinke the very dregges. Tho≈øe converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. had ≈øome grudgings and prickes of con≈øcience, but yet they had none of <hi>Iobs</hi> and <hi>Dauids</hi> fits. <hi>Mathew</hi> at his fir≈øt conver≈øion, ≈øeemes to entertaine Chri≈øt with a fea≈øt, and ≈øo did <hi>Lydia</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles. It is here as in a Womans travell; none travell without paine, yet ≈øome like tho≈øe Hebrew women, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 1. prevent the Mid-wife, and are quicker in di≈øpatch then many others. Some ≈øores we ≈øee are let out with the pricke of a pin, others are ≈øearched to the bottome with the Surgeons launce. Vi≈øcous and gluttonous humours mu≈øt haue a ≈øtronger purge, then ≈øuch as flow of them≈øelues. A hard knot mu≈øt haue a hard wedge, when the Axe alone is able to poli≈øh other peeces of timber. Neither is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ≈øinne that brings the greatne≈ø≈øe of this agony vpon penitents; but ≈øometimes further imployment of ≈øuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons in more worthy ≈øervices. The higher the building, the deeper the foundation, which is not ≈øo requi≈øite in the ruder pyles, &amp;c. This detection of ≈øinne, workes a ≈øeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration from their former cour≈øes, and makes them loath them≈øelues; for God ≈øtops the way of ≈øinners by feares, tyres and wearies them by ≈øorrow, and turnes them by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; and when they begin to ≈øee how the controver≈øie is betwixt God and them≈øelues, they fall from the very ≈øen≈øe of their mi≈øery, to de≈øpaire of helpe in them≈øelues, or any other worldly thing, and ≈øubmit them≈øelues to be di≈øpo≈øed of as God ≈øhall plea≈øe. Thus by the law are they brought to ≈øee, they want Chri≈øt, but without faith they cannot looke vp to him, and therefore faith is infu≈øed, by which the ≈øoule may be comforted. The law is common in this worke, both to the elect and reprobate: yet this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is peculiar and proper to ≈øuch as God hath cho≈øen. No birth without travell, and yet ≈øome children are killed with the paines of the labour: ≈øo God hath none borne his
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3808:161"/>but they come forth at this ≈øtrait pa≈ø≈øage, onely the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate want ≈øtrength to bring forth, and therefore peri≈øh in de≈øpaire. The law brings them both to this conclu≈øion, and ends ever in de≈øpaire, onely the cho≈øen of God finde mercy, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 14.4. <hi>With thee the fatherle≈ø≈øe ≈øhall finde mercie;</hi> God will haue vs brought into the ≈øtraits of poore de≈øolate ≈øhiftle≈ø≈øe Orphanes, before he thinkes vs fit for his mercie. And the deeper wee goe in the ≈øen≈øe of our mi≈øery, the ≈øweeter ≈øhall wee finde the ≈øen≈øe of Gods mercy. <hi>Iob</hi> 33.19. to 25. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.4. <hi>and</hi> 11.28. Chri≈øt (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øeth the Comforter, and the fir≈øt ground that hee ≈øhall lay of our comfort, ≈øhall be to convince our con≈øciences; conviction of ≈øinne, goes before our conviction of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. The Prophet ≈øheweth, how his peace was wrought out of trouble. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 126.5. Wee mu≈øt <hi>≈øow in teares before wee can reape in ioy.</hi> And wee care not if wee may haue a dry harve≈øt, after a wet ≈øeed time. And thus farre haue wee ≈øhewed the preparation; now let vs ≈øee the compo≈øition of grace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the infu≈øion of faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a worke of the Spirit, who infu≈øeth faith into <hi>Infants,</hi> immediately by his ≈øole operation; into men of <hi>riper yeares,</hi> al≈øo by the externall mini≈øtery of the Word, by which it receiueth further increa≈øe, and augmentation; for the word 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>and</hi> 2.2. is both ≈øeed and food, that as it ≈øerues to beget faith, ≈øo it nouri≈øheth the ≈øame. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.44. The babe leaped in the wombe of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ioy. This motion was not naturall, but ≈øpirituall, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> was ≈øanctified in his mothers wombe, and did really reioyce at the pre≈øence of Chri≈øt in the Virgin. Now ≈øanctification pre≈øuppo≈øeth iu≈øtification, and iu≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation faith; yea, this ioy was a true effect of faith in the <hi>Me≈ø≈øias.</hi> And therefore Infants are capable of faith, and may be ≈øaued though they die in their mothers wombe. As for the others faith, it is out of doubt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18.19. And here we are to take notice, where that faith, which is the fir≈øt part of Divinitie, is wrought in vs,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3808:162"/>to wit, in the application of the Spirit after preparation. Faith in the rule is generall, particular to euery one in the application. Furthermore, faith wrought by the Word hath two degrees; the fir≈øt is as a <hi>graine of mu≈øtard ≈øeed,</hi> the ≈øecond, a <hi>Plerophorie,</hi> or full per≈øwa≈øion. Wee are at our fir≈øt but as reeds, feeble plants, to≈ø≈øed and bowed with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind, and with much agitation brui≈øed, loe, yet we are in tender hands, that never brake any, whom their ≈øinnes brui≈øed; never brui≈øed any whom temptations haue bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wee are but flax; and our be≈øt is not a flame, but an ob≈øcure ≈ømoake of grace: loe, yet here is the Spirit as a ≈øoft winde, not as cold water; he will kindle, never quench our little faith: others are better growne, and ≈øtand like ≈øtrong Oakes, vn≈øhaken, vnremoued. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.19. <hi>and</hi> 17.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.19.20.21.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Either the <hi>in≈øition,</hi> grafting, and ≈øciencing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared into Chri≈øt, or el≈øe his <hi>vnion,</hi> and coalition with Chri≈øt. Fir≈øt, the Spirit infu≈øeth faith, by that faith we are put into Chri≈øt, being put into Chri≈øt, we haue vnion and communion with him, and by receiuing vertue from his fulne≈ø≈øe, wee grow vp with him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.2.5. <hi>The branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in Chri≈øt, bringeth forth fruit.</hi> Not ≈øuch as are tyed to Chri≈øt by an outward threed of profe≈ø≈øion: but ≈øuch as haue this vitall ligament of faith, to couple them with Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is this in≈øition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. When being cut off from the wild Oliue, the Spirit of God by faith graffeth and ≈øcienceth vs into the true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, which is the Lord Chri≈øt. If wee were left as we are cut off by the law, wee ≈øhould wither away and peri≈øh; and therefore we are ≈øet in Chri≈øt, that in him wee may grow. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. Wee are ≈øaid to be planted into his life and death.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are wee put into Chri≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By our <hi>effectuall vocation:</hi> when the voyce of God ≈øoundeth in our eares, and in our hearts, come, and we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere againe as by a liuely <hi>Echo,</hi> Lord we come. Hence it
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3808:162"/>is that all ≈øuch as are prepared by the law, are called by the Go≈øpell to come vnto Chri≈øt. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the degrees of our effectuall vocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Fir≈øt, a <hi>meditation</hi> of the mercies of God in Chri≈øt, and from hence that our ≈øinnes are pardonable, and that we haue need of the ≈øame mercy, then of the meanes how wee may obtaine the ≈øame, as deepe ≈øighs to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 52.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten praying by our ≈øelues and others. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 14.2.3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. As al≈øo diligent hearing of the word of God read and preached, and often frequenting of the Mini≈øters and others, for comfort. All the≈øe further the meditations of the mercies of God to ≈øinners. The ≈øecond degree is Gods <hi>gracious perforation,</hi> or boaring of our eares, that the comfortable invitation of comming to Chri≈øt, the onely Phy≈øitian of our Soules, may ≈øound and ring in our eares and hearts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. and wee re≈øound againe, we come Lord at thy call, and ≈øo comming, it plea≈øeth the Father to be≈øtow his Sonne on vs, and vs againe vpon his Sonne. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.29. <hi>and</hi> 17.2.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. And thus ≈øanctified trouble, at the la≈øt, e≈øtabli≈øheth our peace, and the ≈øhaking of the former windes makes the trees of Gods <hi>Eden</hi> take the deeper rooting. Surely, after the mo≈øt toyle≈øome labour is the ≈øweete≈øt ≈øleepe, and after the greate≈øt tempe≈øtes, the ≈øtille≈øt calmes. It is the ble≈ø≈øed Lambe of God that carries all our ≈øinnes into a wildernes of oblivion, quite out of the remembrance of his Father. And if Devils rend and rage in our Soules, he pre≈øently by a word of his mouth, can ca≈øt them out. Never did <hi>Ionas</hi> ≈øo whi≈øt the waues of the Sea, being ca≈øt into it, as Chri≈øt cures the wounds of con≈øcience, being thereunto applied. Here all our throbbing ≈øores receiue their ea≈øe by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and even <hi>Sinai</hi> it ≈øelfe covered with clouds of Gods di≈øplea≈øure, pre≈øently by his Go≈øpell of peace, is enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the trembling Soule that ≈øtands at the foote of it, comforted. Thus it plea≈øeth the Father from <hi>Ebal</hi> the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3808:163"/>mount of cur≈øes, to bring vs to <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> the mount of ble≈ø≈øings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.12.13. And this wee ≈øhall finde mo≈øt true, that as in the Sea the lower the ebbe, the higher the tide: ≈øo the deeper we de≈øcend in humiliation, the higher ≈øhall wee a≈øcend in con≈øolation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is our vnion with Chri≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is that whereby wee being graffed into Chri≈øt, are made one with Chri≈øt our head, and the Church his body.</hi> There is no ≈øcience put into a ≈øtocke, but if it ≈øhall thriue, it mu≈øt fir≈øt be vnited, and become one with the ≈øtocke, and then grow with it: ≈øo it is with vs branches of the wilde Oliue, wee mu≈øt become one with Chri≈øt, if wee de≈øire to thriue in him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.21. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.1.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.22. <hi>and</hi> 5.30. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 61.3.

               <p>Q. <hi>What followes from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our iu≈øtification:</hi> Papi≈øts count it ab≈øurd, for one man to be iu≈øt by another mans iu≈øtice, or wi≈øe by another mans wi≈øedome: wherein they ≈øhew their gro≈ø≈øe ignorance in this point of Divinitie; for Chri≈øt and man being one, haue all things in common, our ≈øinnes and puni≈øhments are his, his righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and ≈øufferings are ours; for vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ever the ground of communion. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the degrees of our Iu≈øtification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; <hi>Imputation</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18.19. <hi>God was in Chri≈øt, reconciling the world vnto him≈øelfe, not imputing their tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is this imputation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the charging of Chri≈øt with all our debts, and the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of vs by his righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi> As God imputes our debt to his Sonne, ≈øo doth he impute his Sonnes ju≈øtice to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the imputation of our debt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The laying of our blame and default, together with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment vpon our Suretie.</hi> Fir≈øt, God imputes all our ≈øinnes to his Sonne, as that fir≈øt ≈øinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> then the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, to wit, both originall and actuall ≈øinne, and hereupon followes a reall obligation of the Sonne of God to payment and puni≈øhment. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.46.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the imputation of Chri≈øts Iu≈øtice vnto vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Fir≈øt, in regard of Adams tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, his conflict with the Devill, and in ≈øpite of all his malice, his per≈øeverance in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; as likewi≈øe the a≈øcribing to vs of his iu≈øtice both originall and actuall, and the merit of his death both fir≈øt and ≈øecond.</hi> And hereupon a reall remi≈ø≈øion, both of puni≈øhment and ≈øinne, and the fruition of ≈øalvation and happine≈ø≈øe. The debt and the di≈øcharge, an≈øwere in a parallell and equall di≈øtance of proportion, <hi>Adams</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with Satan, is fully ≈øatisfied by Chri≈øts combate and conque≈øt: his and our Apo≈øta≈øie and continuance in it, by Chri≈øts obedience and per≈øeverance therein. His and our originall and actuall ≈øinne, is cro≈ø≈øed and cancelled by the perfect lines of Chri≈øts originall and actuall iu≈øtice, drawne over tho≈øe crooked lines. His vnder-going of our puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the fir≈øt and ≈øecond death, takes away our cur≈øe in both, and by ≈øo reall an obligation of him≈øelfe, and full di≈øcharge of it for vs, he brings vs an acquittance ≈øealed in his owne bloud, that all our ≈øinnes are pardoned, and giues vs a new ≈øtocke of grace, for the fruition of a better life; ≈øo that now the poore ≈øinner may ≈øay with comfort to Satans accu≈øations, thou art now put out of office, thou ha≈øt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with mee, here is my di≈øcharge from God, thou mai≈øt goe on and ≈ølander, but thou ha≈øt no power to arre≈øt me, or carry me to thy pri≈øon. He that is in good termes with his Prince, feares not the approch of <hi>Heraulds</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:3808:164"/>or <hi>Pur≈øevants:</hi> he that is out of debt, feares not <hi>Baylifes</hi> or <hi>Sergeants,</hi> but imagines they come vpon ≈øome good me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage: ≈øo the childe of God needs not feare death, but that it comes from God as a me≈ø≈øenger of his bli≈ø≈øe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. He therefore that would die cheerfully, mu≈øt thus know death to be his friend: what is it but the faithful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of our maker, who ever ≈ømiles, or frownes with his ma≈øter; It cannot nouri≈øh, or ≈øhew enmitie, where God favours: when he comes fiercely, and pulls a man by the throat, and ≈øummons him to hell, who can but tremble? then the me≈ø≈øenger is terrible; but the me≈ø≈øage wor≈øe. Oh, you that pro≈øper and flouri≈øh in your ≈øinnes, thinke of this, death deales with you, as Creditors doe with their debters, ≈øayes nothing whiles you trade lu≈øtily for hell: but when once you begin to goe downe the winde, in ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes, cro≈ø≈øes, and povertie, then are≈øt vpon are≈øt, action vpon action, then come the fowles of the aire (I meane the Devils) and ≈øeaze vpon the ≈øicke ≈øoule, as the Ravens vpon a ≈øicke ≈øheepe, then doth con≈øcience begin to write bitter things again≈øt the ≈øinner, and makes him po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the forgotten ≈øinnes of his youth. Hence ari≈øe mi≈øerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpaires, furious ravings of raging con≈øciences, that finde no peace within, le≈ø≈øe without. Oh, ble≈ø≈øed Soule that makes a timely exchange with Chri≈øt, getting his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe for the ≈øinnes thereof. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>and</hi> 8.33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.7. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8.9.10.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is our reconciliation with God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is that whereby the controver≈øie betwixt God and man is fully taken vp, and they are at one againe.</hi> All being fully di≈øcharged, there is nothing betwixt God and man but peace and loue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7.

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Both peace with God, and all the creatures.</hi> P≈øal. 85.8. Rom. 5.1. Iob 5.23. Rom. 8.31. Here is the peace of con≈øcience with God, of charitie among our ≈øelues, of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3808:164"/>amitie, or an holy kind of league with all creatures, and of outward pro≈øperitie, and good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe in all our wayes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What will follow in the ≈øecond place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our adoption:</hi> the branches being vnited once to the ≈øtocke, may fitly be called the Sonnes thereof. And being by nature of the wild Oliue, but now tran≈ølated into the true Oliue, and ≈øpringing forth of it, may aptly be called the ≈øonnes thereof. By nature wee ≈øpring from the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> and are taken from thence, and put into the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ≈øo vnited with him, are made the ≈øons of God by adoption. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.6. Chri≈øt is called the everla≈øting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ≈øo wee are his children: but becau≈øe he begets vs to his Father, and is to deliuer vs vnto him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. Our adoption is in regard of the fir≈øt per≈øon, Chri≈øt onely the meanes thereof, and therefore the Scripture to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion of names, v≈øeth to call vs brethren, in re≈øpect of Chri≈øt, and ≈øonnes in re≈øpect of the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the benefits of our adoption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence wee receiue the ≈øpirit of adoption, whereby wee are made the ≈øonnes of the Father;</hi> and hereupon ≈øuch is the care of our heauenly father, that <hi>he makes all things worke together for our good.</hi> Rom. 8.28. both in pro≈øperitie and adver≈øitie. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. A gaine, by this, Chri≈øt is our brother, and wee are co-heires with him of eternall life, and haue re≈øtored againe vnto vs the ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied v≈øe of all the creatures, yea, and the very Angels are become our attendants, to keepe vs in all our wayes, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 91.11. Furthermore, Chri≈øt hath made vs to his heavenly Father, both Prophets, Prie≈øts, and Kinges, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How be wee heires of that which is purcha≈øed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The purcha≈øe was made by the Father, who gaue his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ≈øonne a price for our redemption;</hi> So that wee haue title by our father who giues vs our right. Secondly, by <hi>≈øonne-≈øhip;</hi> for euery ≈øonne of God is an heire, and we haue
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3808:165"/>giuen vs in this world the earne≈øt of our inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. Oh, then may not all the ≈øonnes of God indure an hard ward≈øhip here on earth, ≈øeeing they know alreadie what they are borne to? Shall men part with good things in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, for hope of better in rever≈øion, and ≈øhall we ≈øticke at any worldly pelfe, for the gaining of heaven? Fie on ≈øuch children, as with <hi>E≈øau,</hi> would ≈øell this birth-right for a me≈ø≈øe of this worlds pottage. Lord make mee one of thy heires, and I will be content to waite thy lei≈øure, for my plea≈øure in inioying.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Hitherto of our being in Chri≈øt, what is our coalition, or growing vp with him?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What is Regeneration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is, as it were, a new conception of vs in the wombe of the Church, by the ≈øpirit of God, and that of the incorruptible ≈øeed of the Word, whereby our corrupt nature is begotten againe, or re≈øtored to the image of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. 2 Pet. 1.4. Tit. 3.5. Gal. 4.6. 2 Cor. 3.17. Colo≈ø. 5.9.10. Eph. 4.23. Which is of the whole man, and in this life is perfect in the parts, though imperfect in the degrees; as a child is a perfect man before he come to his full age. And this may be called our ≈øanctification, whereby of vnholy, wee are renewed by the holy Spirit to the image of our heauenly Father. And here we are to con≈øider two degrees of our ≈øanctification; the fir≈øt is the inchoation, or beginning of it; the ≈øecond is the proce≈ø≈øe, or pa≈ø≈øing forward to greater perfection: hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. our glorification followes our iu≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øanctification being no other thing then a degree thereof, ≈øtill proceeding, profiting, and perfiting in true holine≈ø≈øe, which is the greate≈øt reward of godline≈ø≈øe; for as to doe ill and continue therein, is the greate≈øt mi≈øery: ≈øo to doe well, and per≈øevere therein, is the greate≈øt felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Glory is the reward of vertue, and God cannot crowne his ≈øervants better, then with an increa≈øe of grace. Now this progre≈ø≈øe is orderly, and begins in the Soule, even in the very marrow and ≈øpirit thereof, and ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the outward man, and the actions thereof. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23.25.26.27.28. Fir≈øt, conver≈øion, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation. And here alas, how many ≈øet the Cart before the Hor≈øe, and beginne to change their liues before their lu≈øts, their hands before their hearts, to purge the channell when the fountaine is corrupt, and apply remedies to the head, when the paine is cau≈øed from the impuritie of the ≈øtomacke. What is this but to loppe off the boughes, and never lay the Axe to the roote of the tree, to prune the Vine that it may ≈øprout the more? Mi≈øerable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ≈øhewes, how ≈øuch di≈øordered beginnings, come to mi≈øerable endings. Many ≈øeeme to ab≈øtaine from ≈øinnes which they never abhorre, and leaue ≈øome evils which they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3808:166"/>loath not, and ≈øo like ≈øwine wallow in them againe, or like dogs follow their former vomit, ≈øhe wing plainly, they did never inwardly di≈øta≈øt tho≈øe ≈øinnes, which for a time out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they neglected. Againe, as wee are to ob≈øerue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ≈øo wee are to labour for a thorow change. 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 5.23. Holine≈ø≈øe, as a dram of Muske, perfumes the whole boxe of oyntment, or is placed in the Soule, as the heart in the body, for the conveying of life to all the parts.

Others, thinke it is well if they turne their mindes from error, though they never change their wills from evill; as a reformed Papi≈øt; but an vnreformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant; as wanton in truth, as ever he was wilde in error: others againe thinke they haue done God good ≈øervice if they giue halfe the turne, as pro≈øtrating their bodies to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles, when God ≈øhall haue their hearts; or on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when God hath their bodies, they ≈øuffer the Devill to haue their Soules. When mens bodies are in <hi>Sacello,</hi> their hearts (as <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> complaineth) are at home in <hi>≈øaccellis ≈øuis.</hi> Many by their looke and language, out-face the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whiles their hearts are running and roving af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe. If wee will beleeue, eyther Phylo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or experience, wee ≈øhall finde our hearts where they loue, not where they liue. La≈øtly, others re≈øolue to giue all to God, yet haue a leering eye, and a ≈øquint re≈øpect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øome of their ≈øinnes, with <hi>Lots</hi> wife ca≈øting a longing looke after their old <hi>Sodome.</hi> Know the rule of the Schoole to be mo≈øt certaine, that as vertues, ≈øo vices are coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and though in conver≈øion to temporall good they looke diver≈øe wayes, yet in regard of aver≈øion from eternall good, they beare all one face. Yet this mu≈øt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the comfort of the weake, that vnperfect ≈øanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if it be vnpartiall, is accepted of God.

               <p>Q. <hi>What are the parts of Regeneration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. They are according to the con≈øtitution of the ≈øubiect, and that is of a <hi>Soule</hi> and a <hi>body.</hi> The renovation of the ≈øoule, is either <hi>intellectuall,</hi> or <hi>morall.</hi> Intellectuall, is the clearing of our vnder≈øtanding with ≈øpirituall knowledge, and godly wi≈øedome to v≈øe it. Rea≈øon without grace in the very excellency of it, is but the Devils anvile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he forgeth and hammereth mi≈øchiefe. What is carnall wi≈øedome, but ≈øerpentine ≈øubtiltie? What is skill in lawes but colouring and covering bad cau≈øes and per≈øons, and making truth a no≈øe of waxe to bad ends. Marke, and you ≈øhall ever finde the ring leaders of all lewdne≈ø≈øe and la≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiou≈øne≈ø≈øe, to be men of good wits: but alas, whats all this without a fanctified minde? What are ≈øacred oathes and holy obligations to prophane per≈øons, but as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:3808:167"/>cords, which they ≈ønap in ≈øunder, as fa≈øt as they are giuen them? So well vnder≈øtand they them≈øelues that they doe and vndoe, and di≈øcerne God in his word, as they doe Chri≈øt in his Sacraments, which they regardle≈ø≈øely take, and as ra≈øhly breake. There is no band that they cannot make like a Monkies coller, out of which they will ≈ølip their neckes at plea≈øure. But rea≈øon truely renewed, will be con≈øtant in Religion. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.79. A Candle ≈øet vp in the minde, to di≈øcover darkene≈ø≈øe, and guide our feete in well doing And this is true illumination. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>and</hi> 12.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. Morall ≈øanctification is of the will, and all the affections; of the will, hence freedome to goodne≈ø≈øe; of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hence repentance, which is the change of them all: hence our loue of God and goodne≈ø≈øe, and hereupon in the ab≈øence of good, hope and de≈øire of it, and in the pre≈øence, ioy and gladne≈ø≈øe; Al≈øo our hatred of evill, if it be ab≈øent, feare and flight, if pre≈øent, griefe and ≈øorrow. By meanes whereof Repentance is an aver≈øion from evill, becau≈øe hatred is an affection of ≈øeparation; and a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to good, becau≈øe loue is an affection of vnion. And by meanes of the two cardinall and primitiue affections, all the derivatiue and ≈øubordinate are ≈øet on worke. Our de≈øires are made fervent, which before were ≈øaint in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after God, but now are made impatient of delay. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. Hell mouth may be full of good wi≈øhes. <hi>Num.</hi> 23.10. And they that are troubled with their farmes and fat oxen, &amp;c. count it a ble≈ø≈øed thing to eate bread in Gods kingdome. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.15.16.17. But the≈øe for want of penitent de≈øire may be ≈øaid to want will. It may be ≈øayd of them, they would be good, but they haue no will to it: there is none ≈øo prodigall, or ≈ølothfull, but would be rich; yet wee ≈øay not ≈øuch will be rich, ≈øet it downe, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it <hi>vltimata voluntate.</hi> There are none ≈øo wicked, but at ≈øometimes haue a faint de≈øire to be good, and leaue ≈øinne, but the≈øe cold di≈øpo≈øitions breed and beget imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect e≈ø≈øayes and proffers, and by their negligent propen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3808:167"/>and incon≈øtant bubles, ≈øhew they ≈øpring from corrupt fle≈øh, which can be prodigall in momentanie purpo≈øes and promiles. But ≈øanctified de≈øire is eager and earne≈øt; and with <hi>Dauid</hi> will vow and ≈øweare to obey, yea, and be more vile in ≈øpite of mocking <hi>Michots.</hi> Never was <hi>Ahab</hi> more ≈øicke for a Vineyard, <hi>Ruhel</hi> more ready to die for children, <hi>Si≈øera</hi> for thir≈øt, then the Saint of God is after holine≈ø≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 42.1.2. <hi>and</hi> 81.10. <hi>and</hi> 119.20. <hi>and</hi> 143.7. <hi>Gant.</hi> 2.5. A gaine, this will make our de≈øire of good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and will not ≈øuffer vs to be lazie: Chri≈øt <hi>Math.</hi> 5.4. compares it to hunger, which will breake through the ≈øtone wall, and it will make them hold out, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant without ficklene≈ø≈øe. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.20. As for ioy in the fruition of good, oh, what an heauen brings it into the ≈øoule? This will make vs for ≈øinceritie to delight in the law with the inner man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. It will bring vs to a full ioy. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.24. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.3. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.8. Yea, and will ≈øo ≈øtrengthen vs in the good we haue, that we ≈øhall as well in pa≈ø≈øiue as actiue obedience indure, &amp;c. As for feare of evill it will ≈øet it the right way, making vs to dread more the doing of it, then ≈øuffering in it; and for ≈øorrow it, will make vs ≈øee our ≈øinnes thoroughly, and bewaile them as heartily: and as wee ≈øee in nature, that there is the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument of ≈øeeing and weeping to ≈øhew vs that weeping depends vpon ≈øeeing: ≈øo repentance no ≈øooner takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ≈øinne, but a godly heart begins to bleed for it: and ≈øo he that intellectually ≈øees well, morally weepes well. And by all this we ≈øee, how the mind, will, and affections are ≈øanctified, and the excellent worke of repentance, in regard of all our affections. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.5.6. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.22.23.24. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4.</p>

Glory is the prai≈øe and price of vertue; for as ≈øhame and repentance are bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and curbes to ≈øinne: ≈øo prai≈øe, fame, glory, and honor are the ≈øpurres and ≈øpeeders of vertue. <hi>Prai≈øe</hi> followes the beginning of a good action <hi>fame</hi> runs with it as it ≈øpreads further abroad, and <hi>glory</hi> is for the perfection of it, when euery mouth rings of it, and euery heart honours it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke, that the wicked one day ≈øhall honour the godly, and ≈øpeake of their glory, to their owne ≈øhame, and how≈øoever they ≈øpeake all manner of ill of them in this world, yet often doe their hearts checke them with their innocency, and to ≈øee their honour, maugre the malice of all gaine-≈øayers. A field of ≈øinceritie charged with the deeds of pietie, cannot but be accompli≈øht with the cre≈øts of glory: all the fame which men haue ≈øought by buildings, by acts of Chivalry, and by ≈øuch other cour≈øes, which the light of nature offereth and effecteth, for the enobling of it ≈øelfe, time devoureth it, and within an age or two it is cleane put out: but that glory which ≈øpringeth from the rootes of godline≈ø≈øe, no tract of time can make to wither, no bla≈øt of venemous tongues can overcome. It ≈øhall breake out as the Sunne, in ≈øpite of all darkning clouds, it is watered with the dew of heauen, and it ≈øhall grow and increa≈øe, in ≈øpite of the Devill him≈øelfe.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3808:169"/>of the interpo≈øition of plea≈øures, or mi≈øeries, could not ≈øo well be ≈øeene. If thou be good, thou maye≈øt looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ≈øee heauen open with <hi>Steven,</hi> and the glorious Angels attending, as ready to carry vp thy ≈øoule. If wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then mu≈øt thou looke downeward, and ≈øee three ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ≈øpectacles; <hi>death, iudgement,</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> one beyond another; and all to be pa≈ø≈øed through by thy ≈øoule, and the very Devils attend to lay fa≈øt hold of it, to carry it to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this life thou wa≈øt content with a condition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with bea≈øts, and therefore in the other, art thou one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted for Devils. Art thou not (O wretched man) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, houre in danger; and wilt thou not be in doubt to ≈øtep into them? Remember, the wicked are ≈øayd <hi>to turne into hell,</hi> and their merry dance, to haue a mi≈øerable down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. What? mu≈øt thou be intreated (like a mad-man) to be good to thy ≈øelfe? Had≈øt thou rather feele then feare the≈øe torments? Rather endure them, then for a ≈øhort time thinke of them? Where then is thy iudgement become Where are thy right wits? or where, at lea≈øt, is thy ≈øelfe-loue? Can≈øt thou pry after profit for the world, and bee carefull to avoyd both lo≈ø≈øe and harme; and yet never thinke what may hurt thy foule, and loo≈øe thee heaven? Oh, the coldne≈ø≈øe of care, that will not provide how to prevent the≈øe mi≈øeries. Wee thinke heauen ≈øtands by our bed ≈øides, and <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs</hi> will bring vs thither; when indeed hell ≈øtands neerer, &amp; is readier for entrance. Heauen is compared to a hill, hell to a hole, hee that climbes vpward mu≈øt ≈øweat and blow, he that will tumble downeward, ≈øhall at ea≈øe fall into the pit. Oh, then let vs neither refu≈øe the hardne≈ø≈øe, nor the hazards of the way: but as <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and his Armour-bearer, pa≈ø≈øed betwixt two rockes; one <hi>Bozez,</hi> the other, <hi>Seneh;</hi> that is, foule and thorny: ≈øo wee mu≈øt make ≈øhift here below, to climbe on our hands and knees; and when we are come vp, wee ≈øhall ≈øee our victory and triumph. Let vs with the holy and happy Apo≈øtles leaue all, both plea≈øures and advantages, to follow Chri≈øt; and by a foreible entry, by a maine and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3808:170"/>manly breach, through all difficulties, to ≈øetle our ≈øoules in the cogitation of the≈øe la≈øt things. Remember, that the be≈øt ≈øuite of apparell is laid vp in the wardrobe or heauen; here we mu≈øt be either in blacke, mourning; or in red, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuted; It matters not, what ragges or colours we weare with men; ≈øo wee may hereafter walke with our Sauiour in white, and raigne with him in glory. In the meane time, let vs often exerci≈øe, to acquaint our nature, &amp; draw it into ≈øome familiariue with the ioyes of heauen; And (as one that maketh a fire of greene wood) not be tyred with blowing, vntill our devotion be ≈øet on flame; for the habite of vertues doth grow and increa≈øe with the exerci≈øe of their acts. Doe wee not ≈øee, that our glorification is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe but our multiplied ≈øanctification? And tho≈øe that endevour God will helpe, and by our per≈øi≈øtance, and his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, wee ≈øhall haue continuance and plea≈øure in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py cour≈øes; for as one that is either weary, or weake, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth ≈øtrength by taking his food, although he eateth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, without either appetite, or ta≈øte: ≈øo holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, which giue both fewell and flame vnto devotion, doe increa≈øe in vs ≈øome ≈øpirituall ≈øtrength, even when to vs they yeeld little ≈øpirituall ≈øolace.

                  <hi>The dutie to be performed to God by vs, the power of the holy ≈øpirit working in vs by our faith.</hi> Luk. 1.74. Rom. 6.8. &amp; 12.1. 1 Cor. 6.20. Tit. 2.11.12.14. 1 Pet. 1.17.18.19. P≈øal. 56.13. Eph. 2.10. 1 The≈ø≈ø. 1.8. Faith, and the inward di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions of the ≈øoule are as the kernell; outward acts are as the ≈øhell, he therefore is but a deafe nut, that hath outward ≈øeruice, without inward faith: And yet this divine Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy teacheth vs, not onely to referre our ≈øpeculations, but our affections, and all the di≈øpo≈øitions of our ≈øoules to action, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. So that as our ≈øeruice mu≈øt be grounded vpon our faith, ≈øo mu≈øt our faith be reduced to ≈øeruice. There is no faith but it workes: It is neither idle nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ≈øet the whole man a doing well. In Rethoricke wee ≈øay, there may be Elocution without pronunciation: but in Diuinitie, wee cannot haue the fir≈øt part of the Art without the ≈øecond. This Solifidian, like <hi>Ae≈øops</hi> Henne, too fat to lay, may ≈øit at <hi>Rome</hi> as iu≈øtified: but is pittied by <hi>Dauid,</hi> P≈øal. 119. <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øaith, there may betrue faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes, as if a man ≈øhould haue faith, and not liue by it, or liue and not performe the act of life. Papi≈øts erre
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3808:171"/>gro≈ø≈øely in both parts of divinitie; for, they teach faith in the Church and creatures, and ≈øo make not God the end of it; If the Church, or Saints may terminate faith, it will re≈øt there, and goe no further for the goale. Againe, as in faith they ≈øhoot not at God, no more doe they in workes; for they looke to gaine and merite heauen by them. Al≈øo hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and civill men know neither the ingenuitie of faith, nor liberalitie of workes, for they walke before men and not before God: but they are here ≈øoundly le≈ø≈øoned that would ≈øo di≈ø≈øemble with God; as if ≈øeruice con≈øi≈øted onely in wearing of liueries, in taking of wages, in making of curte≈øies, and ki≈ø≈øing of hands, I meane, they put on the cognizance of Chri≈øtianity in Bapti≈øme, know how to liue vpon the trencher of Gods providence in their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to giue him the complements of a fa≈øhionable profe≈ø≈øion, &amp;c. I know there is nothing more ea≈øie, or more common then this: ≈øuch ≈øervants are as v≈øefull for God, as drunken ≈øeruing men for hone≈øt ma≈øters, which are not to be found, when there is mo≈øt v≈øe for them. Ran≈øacke then thy heart (O ≈øinner) and finde ≈øound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God, firme re≈øolution to goodne≈ø≈øe, true hatred of ≈øinne: ran≈øacke thy life, and finde the truth of workes, the life of obedience, or els <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> ≈øhall goe before thee into heauen. Doe not thinke, that becau≈øe thou ha≈øt gotten Gods liuery on thy backe, and his name in thy mouth, that thou ≈øhalt be able to out-face all reproofes. <hi>God will ≈ømite thee,</hi> God will ≈ømite, <hi>O thou whited wall.</hi> But if the civilly righteous ≈øhall not be ≈øaued, where ≈øhall the notorious ≈øinner appeare? A Chri≈øtian, and yet a forme below a <hi>Iew?</hi> For ≈øhame, what are wee, and where is our emulation? Heauen is our goale, wee all ≈øay wee runne, loe, the very <hi>Seribes</hi> and <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> are gotten before many of vs, and what ≈øafetie can it be for vs to come ≈øhort of tho≈øe, that by the verdict of our Sauiour, come ≈øhort of heauen, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.20? Be zealous, and never be at re≈øt, till thou get a ≈øtep further then the mo≈øt hone≈øt civill man, and that is both in faith and workes to gaine ≈øinceritie.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3808:171"/>which is the <hi>girdle of truth.</hi> Eph. 6.14. Thinke thy ≈øelfe but a loo≈øe man as long as thou wante≈øt it, &amp; thy graces, never ≈øo excellent, will be ≈øhaken off with a ≈øtorme, as loo≈øe garments with the wind. And here the Proverbe is mo≈øt true, <hi>vngirt, vnble≈øt, &amp;c.</hi> Obedience, if wee re≈øpect Gods iu≈øtice, ought to be perfect, yet it is ≈øo farre perfect in vs, as it is wrought in vs by the ≈øpirit and faith; wherein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly there is no imperfection; for it is the oppo≈øition of corruption, that makes faith little. A ≈ømall fire warmes but a little, and the rea≈øon is not in the heat, but the coldne≈ø≈øe of the weather, therefore as farre as wee beleeue wee obey God perfectly, and our faith is ≈øayd to be in part, becau≈øe the greater part is corrupt: onely this is the comfort, that the new man ≈øhall gaine ground of the old; for though the old man, by his long experience, often deceiue the yong man: yet the flouri≈øhing age of the one ≈øhall grow riper in yeeres and experience, when the old man in the end ≈øhall fall to plaine dotage. The ≈øpirit, faith, and man are all agents in well doing, and man de≈øerues the lea≈øt pray≈øe; for he is beholding to the Spirit and faith, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any reward of his workes: I wonder at Papi≈øts, that they ≈øhould make tho≈øe workes mo≈øt meritorious, which are mo≈øt remote from the fountaine of well-doing. The hand in Almes, or feete in Pilgrimages, or both in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian warre, de≈øerue lea≈øt, if the reward be according to the doer; for then the ≈øpirit and faith will carry all away, and teach the whole man to be thankfull for mercies; and not to ≈øtand pleading for merites.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein ≈øtands our obedience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Either in <hi>ob≈øervation</hi> of the law, <hi>invocation</hi> of God, or <hi>celebration</hi> of Sacraments. Faith makes vs euery way duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our Maker. It moues vs to ≈øeeke him in all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and mo≈øt willingly ≈øubmit vnto his lawes, devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ≈øue vnto him in our prayers, and holily to receiue the pledge of his loue. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19.20. They that for want of faith become weake in doing, will ≈øoone become wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3808:172"/>of well-doing. Dead work is ≈øoone giuen over for want of this life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The rule of all good, and condemner of all evill.</hi> Here alone may we try our actions, how acceptable they are vnto God. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 8.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth God require of man obedience thereunto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Man was to performe it by the <hi>law of creation;</hi> for, God made him able to doe it, and made his covenant with him for him≈øelfe, and his heires, vpon the promi≈øe of life, for the keeping of it, and threatning death, if he ≈øhould breake it, and ≈øealed the ≈øame with two Sacraments. The one, of the <hi>tree of life;</hi> the other, of the <hi>knowledge of good and evill.</hi> Gen. 2.9.17. Lev. 18 5. Rom. 10.5.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How had man this law by creation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It was written in his heart; for as he was made by it, ≈øo was he governed accordingly. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let vs make man in our image, &amp;c.</hi> Fir≈øt, God ≈ølamped his law vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. and then left him to his ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to conforme him≈øelfe and his actions to the will of that God, who with his owne finger did write vpon the table of his heart, <hi>holine≈ø≈øe to Iehovah.</hi> The iron by the tincture of the Load-≈øtone, points to a center, &amp; is drawn too and fro by it: ≈øo the heart of man hauing receiued the invnction of an holy law, was to be drawne from point to point, as the will of God had ordered: onely here is the difference, that the Load≈øtone moues the iron-naturally: but Gods law was to ≈øtirre the heart freely, and as a cau≈øe by coun≈øell, and ≈øo might be oppo≈øed by mans free will, hauing libertie to turne with the law, or again≈øt it. Oh, ble≈ø≈øed be God that in place of this principle, to moue to obedience, hath giuen another, by who≈øe melting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or commanding entreaties, wee thinke nothing too good, too hard, or deere for God. If <hi>Maryes</hi> teares will wa≈øh Chri≈øts feete, ≈øhee will not ≈øticke to poure them out, neither will ≈øhee thinke her hayre too good to be the to well to wipe his wa≈øhen feete, or any <hi>Spikenard</hi> too co≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3808:172"/>for to embalme his head. <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> will not deny Chri≈øt his owne tombe to lie in. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his wealth ≈øhall wa≈øt before he will want Chri≈øt. Faith is the new principle that will take no repul≈øe; It can con≈øtraine and extort more from vs then all rackes and ≈øtrapadoes, allure more then all wages and prizes. Doth not this <hi>Magnes,</hi> as ea≈øily draw weightie iron, as other <hi>Iet</hi> doth ≈øtrawes? What heart can re≈øi≈øt faith? Let it but make the motion, and ≈øtraight it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines what it plea≈øeth. It ≈øtands not without doores (as one ≈øayth well) like a <hi>mendicant flexanimous per≈øwader,</hi> but enters into the clo≈øets of the heart, ≈øhootes the barres, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes the boults, takes away all reluctation and oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, infu≈øeth a pliable willingne≈ø≈øe, and brings with it ≈øuch a loue of Chri≈øt, that wee are con≈øtrained to obey. It makes docible the dogged nature of man, and turnes a wilde and haggard di≈øpo≈øition, into a morigerous and man≈øuete behauiour. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 11.6.7.8.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Can the naturall man performe this law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; for it is almo≈øt wholly blotted out by ≈øinne, and as it were eaten out with the ru≈øt of corruption:</hi> ≈øo that man in this e≈øtate is altogether exorbitant in his wayes, and cannot ≈øo much as doe it in thought, will, or de≈øire. Furthermore, the very Legions of darkene≈ø≈øe, and powers of hell haue ≈øo long held po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion in the ≈øtrong Fort of the heart, that they plead pre≈øcription, ≈øcorning, as the <hi>Iebu≈øites,</hi> to be elected out of their impregnable tower: ≈øo that man both outwardly and inwardly is made vnable to plea≈øe God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. Oh Lord God of heauen, who ≈øhall helpe mee ≈øubdue <hi>Nebuzaradan, Goliah, Hollofernes,</hi> my ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging lu≈øts, that are too mightie for mee? Surely, through thee alone I ≈øhall doe valiantly, and if by faith I may but once touch the hemme of my Sauiours garment, I ≈øhall finde vertue enough to recover ≈øtrength againe, and foyle all my adver≈øaries; yea, by it ≈øhall I be able to roule away the ≈øtone from the caue of <hi>Makpelah,</hi> and bring out tho≈øe hidden Kings, that haue domineered and tyrannized over mee ≈øo long, throw them downe vnder my feete, trample
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3808:173"/>vpon their neckes, and triumph over them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But is there nothing of the law remaining in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, ≈øo much is left ≈øtill as may witne≈ø≈øe man to be made for God and his wor≈øhip, and leaue him without all excu≈øe in his ≈øinne, when God ≈øhall inflict hell, death, and damnation vpon him for the violation of his mo≈øt holy law.</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>and</hi> 2.1.14. Me thinkes as <hi>Libertines, Cyrenians,</hi> men of <hi>Alexandria, Cilicia, A≈øia, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 6.9.10. were not able to re≈øi≈øt the wi≈øedome, and ≈øpirit by which <hi>Steven</hi> ≈øpake: ≈øo the mo≈øt tran≈øcendent and ≈øublimated wits in the world, bee they never ≈øo ob≈øtinate, ≈øhal not be able to gain≈øay the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their con≈øciences. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Can a man then in any proportion an≈øwere the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; of him≈øelfe</hi> (as hath beene ≈øayd) <hi>he cannot; for if we could ≈øee the true image of a naturall man, wee ≈øhould ≈øee that little light that yet remaineth in him to be re≈øi≈øted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted.</hi> Thinke of ≈øome one man compounded of all the vices of mankind, and in whom all outragious ≈øins raigne, and ≈øuch a one is euery man by nature, <hi>a Iudas, a Iulian,</hi> &amp;c. Wee hate the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ≈øpit at the name of <hi>Iudas,</hi> raile on <hi>Pilate,</hi> condemne the cruell butchers of Chri≈øt, and with <hi>Hazael</hi> count them wor≈øe then dogs, &amp;c. But alas, we ≈øee not our ≈øelues. How many that can bla≈øpheme, ≈øweare Chri≈øt quite over, cur≈øe, ≈øwagger, lye, oppre≈ø≈øe, boyle with lu≈øt, ≈øcoffe, ryot, liue like debauched men; yea, like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bea≈øts, or rather vncleane Devils: and yet will bee crying <hi>Ho≈øanna;</hi> but let them ≈øay what they will, they are <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> Doe not wee all cruelly vexe and wound him with our ≈øinnes? And is not euery of our ≈øinnes, as a thorne, nayle, and ≈øpeare to him? Thou that poure≈øt downe thy drunken carowies, thou giue≈øt thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a potion of gall; and while thou di≈øpi≈øe≈øt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt of his ≈øervants, thou ≈øpitte≈øt on his face, and whiles thou putte≈øt on thy proud dre≈ø≈øes, and lifte≈øt vp thy vaine heart, with high conceits, thou ≈øette≈øt the crowne of thornes on his head, &amp;c. Thus euery man when he little thinketh it, <hi>crucifies againe to him≈øelfe the Sonne of God, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3808:173"/>makes a very mocke of him;</hi> to <hi>them≈øelues,</hi> not in <hi>him≈øelfe,</hi> for he is farre enough out of their reach. Alas, poore man knowes not what is within him. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing his eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, confe≈ø≈øeth that no good did dwell in him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. and that evill was ever pre≈øent to doe him a mi≈øchiefe, as if it watched opportunities to doe an ill turne to the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How then comes it to pa≈ø≈øe, that many naturall men are ≈øo civill and hone≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>God by his re≈øtraining ≈øpirit doth bridle them ≈øo farre, and in ≈øuch mea≈øure as plea≈øeth him, to the good of his who dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them:</hi> but all this re≈øtraint of evill maketh them not good before God, neither tho≈øe actions which are done by them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. Men are to be the new workman≈øhip of God, before they can be his workemen. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ≈øinne mu≈øt goe before zeale in good workes. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. They onely which haue beleeued in God, know how to be carefull in the maintenance of good workes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Wee mu≈øt be in Chri≈øt, before we can walke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. I know (≈øayth God) that thou ha≈øt done this in the vprightne≈ø≈øe of thy heart. Some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions may haue a charitable con≈øtruction in the very wicked, and yet the whole cour≈øe of their life be ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wicked: onely the godly are vpright in their way. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.2. <hi>Dauid</hi> was vpright in all things, ≈øaue onely in the matter of <hi>Vriah.</hi> A godly man is habitually good, when he is actually evill, and a wicked man is habitually evill, when he is actually good. Hence it may be ≈øayd, the godly keepe tho≈øe commandements they breake, and that the wicked breake tho≈øe commandements which they keepe. And therefore except the habite of obedience be infu≈øed, the out ward act is nothing with God, and le≈ø≈øe to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. The liuing God is not ≈øerued as long as the con≈øcience is not purged from dead workes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is the Law further con≈øidered in man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. As it is knowne of man in it ≈øelfe, and in his reward, and applyed to the fact, good, or bad, it is called <hi>con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:3808:174"/>for con≈øcience is either the reading of the law in the heart; or the law read vnto it by the vnder≈øtanding. It is Gods ≈øpie, or Pinne≈ø≈øe ≈øent out to make di≈øcouery of the coa≈øt, and to returne adverti≈øement. Onely ≈øinne ≈øo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds her way, that often ≈øhee comes home againe, and ≈øayes nothing. For blind and ignorant con≈øciences ≈øpeake peace, or hold their peace, becau≈øe they haue not skill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to accu≈øe, and find fault: they ≈øwallow downe not onely flies and gnatts, but camels and beames, and dige≈øt all well enough. Surely, if the Soule were not fallen well a≈øleepe, and had drawne the curtaines about it, it could not concoct ≈øo well. Whiles the ≈øcales were vpon <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, he was aliue and quiet, and thought concupi≈øcence, the ≈øinke, and breeder of all ≈øinne, to be no ≈øinne. Alas, how many thinke, becau≈øe con≈øcience is an Inmate, that ≈øhe mu≈øt ≈øtand by, heare, and ≈øay nothing? And becau≈øe it is now vacation, thinke tearme time will come no more, and that they ≈øhall never be vexed and troubled with any law ca≈øes, but they are to know that this calme is but the mother of a ≈øtorme, and that ere long they ≈øhall e≈øpie a <hi>weather-gawle</hi> in the ayre. And the little cloud will bring a da≈øhing ≈øhower of fire and brim≈øtone vpon the Soule. The watch of the Clocke goes not, and the wheeles ≈øtand ≈øtill, being clam'd, and ru≈øted in their ioynts: but when the heauy waights of ≈øinne, ≈øhall be hung vpon the lines by the hand of God, no mercy counterpoyzing them, then ≈øhall the hammer ≈øtrike thicke, and indi≈øtinctly, and his tongue blab out his owne ≈øhame. Oh, how pitifull a knell ≈øhall that be, when the Lord ≈øhall knole the great bell of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and make his ≈øinnes ≈øound loud in his eares? Oh, the dolefull pa≈ø≈øing bell, that finners ≈øhall heare, when they are giuing vp the Gho≈øts to their Creator and Maker. Let vs in the feare of God thinke of it, and ≈øuffer con≈øcience to doe his office; for thereby we ≈øhall prevent Satan by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing our ≈øelues, and God, by iudging our ≈øelues betimes. What can Satan (the Accu≈øer of Man) ≈øay, when man by his con≈øcience hath ≈øaid it before him? Truely, this will ≈øtop
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3808:174"/>his mouth; for wee being accu≈øers of our ≈øelues, God will become our di≈øcharger, and then Satan ≈øhall but be our ≈ølanderer. Againe, God hath left con≈øcience to keepe his Court here below, and to ≈øit as judge, and God will not either <hi>ex mero officio,</hi> or <hi>promoto,</hi> call vs againe, if we will di≈øcharge our ≈øelues there.

If this inferiour court be corrupt, then there is a court of Parliament to reforme it, and God him≈øelfe will call it, and make our iudge a witne≈ø≈øe again≈øt our ≈øelnes; for God left con≈øcience with man as a iudge to ab≈øolue, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and he will bring it before him≈øelfe as a witne≈ø≈øe to excu≈øe, or accu≈øe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15.</p>

               <p>A. Wee are to vnder≈øtand that God renewed his law to his Church, and did write it againe in their hearts by his ble≈ø≈øed ≈øpirit, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. Fir≈øt, that cur ≈øinnes might be the better di≈øcovered vnto vs, and that wee might ≈øee how we had eaten the law out of our hearts. Secondly, that by it we might ≈øee what we ought to doe, and finding thereby the evill we would not doe, to be done by vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. and that good omitted which wee ≈øhould doe, wee might as by a Schoole-ma≈øter be driuen to Chri≈øt, who hath both ≈øuffered for our ≈øinnes, and performed the law throughly for vs, which being made ours by imputation, wee al≈øo may be reputed doers of it, and ≈øo be iu≈øtified, as before hath beene ≈øaid <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But hath the law no further v≈øe for vs?</hi>

What≈øoever in it is ≈øinne, is couered by Chri≈øts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and pardoned in and for him; for he is our <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> with the Father, and <hi>propitiation for our ≈øinnes;</hi> ≈øo that that which is good is accepted of God, becau≈øe it is done in obedience to him, and the re≈øt is not layd to our charge, becau≈øe it is di≈øcharged in Chri≈øt. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Can it merit any thing with God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No; for it is very imperfect; and if it ≈øhould haue his right merit, it might more iu≈øtly expect puni≈øhment then reward. For as in a rude eare, that mu≈øicke may pa≈ø≈øe for currant, which a skilfull iudgement will condemne for cour≈øe: ≈øo, in the ≈øight of God, there will appeare both er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and defects in all tho≈øe actions, which in our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were perfectly performed. Let vs but once begin to throw our thoughts freely into euery corner of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences, and wee ≈øhall pre≈øently begin to cry out, <hi>Lord enter not into iudgement with thy ≈øervants; for in thy ≈øight ≈øhall no man liuing be iu≈øtified.</hi> P≈øal. 143.2. Rom. 3.20. and 4.6. Gal. 2.16. Neither will that dip or die of our workes in the bloud of Chri≈øt helpe vs: for how≈øoever the colour, or tincture may be perfect, yet the cloth it ≈øelfe is ≈øo ≈øtained, that it receiues no perfect wa≈øh, or holine≈ø≈øe in graine, that perfectly an≈øwers the ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe of Gods iu≈øtice. Oh, the perfidious heart of man, that would ≈øteale the vertue from the die, and giue it to the cloth: ≈øurely, it is more hard to be ≈øtripped of our pride, then of our gold and lewels; for even when tho≈øe, and ≈øuch like out ward ornaments are gone, many times the≈øe inward rags ≈øwell vp the ≈øoule. The≈øe are the Scorpions and Snakes (as <hi>Iereme</hi> termed the errors of <hi>Origen</hi>) among≈øt which poore Papi≈øts haue walked, priding them≈øelues in their owne clouts for the ≈øuppo≈øed die they haue receiued: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of ≈øuch a ≈øhift, puts it off againe, and ≈øayes it is ≈øafer
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3808:175"/>for a Chri≈øtian to renounce the merites of his workes, not ≈øo much for their in certaintie, as the imperfection of their iu≈øtice, and danger of vaine glory, and to re≈øolue and teach men to repo≈øe their whole confidence, in the mercy and bountie of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is the Law di≈øtributed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is either concerning the wor≈øhip of God, or loue of our neighbour.</hi> Math. 22.37.38.39.40.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whatas the wor≈øhip of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That reverent re≈øpect and loue wherewith wee are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his maie≈øtie with our whole man.</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24. Mat. 22.37.38. The Schoolemen define it to be an immediate act of the will vpon God: but this is the whole rule of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which is nothing el≈øe but the ordering of the Will, ≈øo as it may plea≈øe God. Now the act of the will is either to beleeue, or obey, and obedience is either immediate, as pietie, or mediate, as charitie. Hence the loue of my neighbour is not an immediate act vpon God, and in this ≈øen≈øe, wor≈øhip is well di≈øtingui≈øhed from charitie: as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no neerer obiect then God. The loue of man is ≈øo farre forth: peece of Divinitie, as it is done in obedience to God, and his law: other wi≈øe it is but an act of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp;c. Furthermore, it appeares, that wor≈øhip and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are not all one, nor that prayer is all the wor≈øhip of God, though indeed it be an onely part, the Soule therein mo≈øt immmediately conferring with God; for wor≈øhip, if it be taken for an act of the will is as large as all Divinitie, if for an immediate act of obedience, as large as the fir≈øt Table. if for an act of the affections, mouing God with things agreeable to his will, as large as prayer; for the act of the will falling into the affections, and turning them about with earne≈øt intreaties and thankes, is the divine wor≈øhip of prayer; In beleeuing, obeying, praying, celebrating of Sacraments, I wor≈øhip God: but immediate obedience is that which is required in the fir≈øt Table, when without all other re≈øpects, I loue God purely and ≈øincerely: whereas in duties of charitie, I am bound by the law to haue re≈øpect
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3808:176"/>vnto my neighbour for Gods ≈øake, and in prayer I re≈øpect mine owne wants, and come to God for ≈øupply, cyther in ≈øuites, or thankes, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luk</hi> 10.27.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is the Law coneerning Gods wor≈øhip di≈øtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is either concerning the wor≈øhipping of him alone, or the wor≈øhipping of him in due manner;</hi> of him alone, or with his alone wor≈øhip. Fir≈øt, wee mu≈øt haue him for our God, and then giue him his due. And therefore when the Papi≈øts ≈øay, that the ≈øecond Commandement forbids not images, but Heathen Idoles, counted for Gods, they are deceiued, for it is the fir≈øt, and not the ≈øecond Commandement that forbids ≈øuch Idolatry. <hi>Math.</hi> 4.10. <hi>and</hi> 15.3.9.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the wor≈øhip of God alone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is the fir≈øt Commandement, <hi>thou ≈øhalt haue no other Gods before mee, or in my eyes.</hi> Exod. 20.3. This is a pure Commandement, and brings the ≈øoule to a mo≈øt ≈øimple wor≈øhip of one, that it may not be di≈øtracted with many.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. That God is to be wor≈øhipped, and God alone, and that truely, and totally. <hi>Truely,</hi> that there be no halting, <hi>wholly,</hi> that there be no halving. And all this mu≈øt be done as in his eyes. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, eye-≈øervice is a fault with men: but let vs but ≈øerue God whiles he ≈øees vs, and it is enough. He mu≈øt haue all, or he will haue nothing; the Devill will be glad of any corner, for he knowes full well, that if he haue any part, God him≈øelfe will haue none. <hi>Salomons</hi> Curtizan talkes of dividing, and many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ≈øhare them≈øelues betwixt God and the world, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the Mediator.

I may well ≈øay of my heart (as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar</hi>) <hi>is it not a little one?</hi> Alas, it is even too little for God; I need not thinke of taking in an Inmate, it is happine≈ø≈øe enough, if God will vouch≈øafe to take vp all the roomes for him≈øelfe, and inlarge them for his owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is commanded?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That God is to be wor≈øhipped with his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12.16. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in repeating the law, bids the people keepe it as God hath commanded. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. <hi>It ≈øhall be your righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe to ob≈øerue and doe, as the Lord hath commanded.</hi> Our practi≈øe, and Gods precept mu≈øt goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and his will, nor ours, mu≈øt be done.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is forbidden?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A All Will wor≈øhip, devi≈øed by man. Religion is not humane policie, but Gods divinitie: yet in circum≈øtances which are rather the ornaments then the elements of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of the bye, then the ≈øub≈øtance, the Church is to be heard; for nothing is left in the power of the Church but things indifferent: that which is commanded, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is to ≈øtand again≈øt all rules of men, and <hi>God mu≈øtrather be obeyed then man.</hi> Act. 5.29. Notwith≈øtanding, this is the folly of many, that in things indifferent, will haue a ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Text to allow and warrant euery particular. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Church, or Magi≈øtrate, to command in the≈øe vpon the generall warrant of the word: they that oppo≈øe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3808:177"/>mu≈øt bring the particular inhibition from heauen, or el≈øe they neither obey God, nor man. If they take from the Magi≈øtrate power in things indifferent, they leaue him none at all; for, in all the re≈øt, he is as well bound as any other man. And here ≈øome que≈øtions may be moued; fir≈øt, whether of things indifferent, any image may be made of Religion? It is plaine, of God we are to make none, for he is onely to be taught by his owne voyce, and not by any image. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. To teach his nature and maie≈øtie by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, is to turne his truth into a lie. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. But of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ≈øelfe, there may be images and ≈øimilitudes; for, man hath two ≈øen≈øes that are aboue all the re≈øt; apt to teach or receiue in≈øtruction for the minde, the eye and the eare: And almightie God hath provided, that we might learne by both: hence his word for the care in ≈øpeaking, and the eye in reading: hence in the old law his ≈øervice was full of vi≈øible ≈øacrifices, and many other images of holy things. And now the wor≈øhip being more ab≈øtracted from ≈øen≈øe, wee haue Sacraments, which are images and ≈øimilitudes of holy things. But all the que≈øtion is, what man may doe in the≈øe things? for the precept is, <hi>thou ≈øhalt not make, &amp;c.</hi> I an≈øwere; Images of Religion, are either in the ≈øub≈øtance of it, or the circum≈øtances: In the fir≈øt, man hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for the whole e≈ø≈øence of Divinitie, mu≈øt haue God for he ≈øole Author. In the ≈øecond, man hath power for <hi>time, lace,</hi> and <hi>per≈øon,</hi> and ≈øome outward rites and ceremonies of morall and hi≈øtoricall ≈øignification; for ≈øuch ceremonies and circum≈øtances as are of no ≈øignification, are mo≈øt idle and ab≈øurd in Gods wor≈øhip. The hi≈øtory of the Bible in pictures of <hi>Kings, Prie≈øts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> of <hi>Altars, Bea≈øts, Cherubins, Arke, Mercie-≈øeat, Temple, &amp;c.</hi> are not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: yet wee are to vnder≈øtand, that the≈øe things ≈øerue onely for our intellectuall part, and that God is not to bee wor≈øhipped in, or at any of the≈øe things, or the like. The Iewes were commanded to wor≈øhip God in the images of things to come, and the thing being come, wee are not to wor≈øhip in them, but learne from them. They may bee to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3808:177"/>vs of hi≈øtoricall v≈øe, but not of morall; for they are cea≈øed, as appendices, or additions to the morall law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are left vs for in≈øtruction, not for adoration. Yet ≈øtill it remaines, whether the Church haue any power to ≈øet vp religious images, of morall ≈øignification, and ≈øuch as ought to carry with them not onely our vnder≈øtandings, but our wills and affections vnto the performance of ≈øome morall dutie? I an≈øwere; if morall be taken for the rule, the Church may pre≈øcribe no ≈øuch duties, they re≈øt then onely vpon the morall law of God: but if morall be taken for manners, then it cannot be denied, but the Church hath power to order the outward man in good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and morally to teach him by humane rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, yea, even ≈øuch as ≈øhould outwardly helpe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; for morall decency and order, ought to tend to edification. Now that the Church hath power in this generall ≈øen≈øe, to make ≈øome religious images, I ≈øhew by this example. <hi>Io≈øh.</hi> 22. The Altar of te≈øtimony was not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but religious, as may appeare by <hi>ver.</hi> 24.25.26.27.28.29.34. It was not to di≈øtingui≈øh their borders, but to te≈øtifie that they were Gods people, and had all one God, and that this Altar ≈øhould put them and their po≈øteritie in mind, to ≈øacrifice vpon Gods Altar, where≈øoever it ≈øhould be ≈øet, &amp;c. Yet this Altar of morall ≈øignification, was ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Gods Altar, and an help to the people to bring them to wor≈øhip God as he had commanded. And ≈øo mu≈øt the Church doe nothing in things indifferent, hut as they helpe forward the ≈øub≈øtance and truth of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip. And in this ≈øen≈øe, the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme, a tran≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ≈øigne of Chri≈øt crucified, made in remembrance of the Cro≈ø≈øe whereon he was crucified, cannot be denied, but to be an image of Religion, and of morall ≈øignification; which if it ≈øhould come in to thru≈øt out Gods image, I meane, water, wee had as iu≈øt cau≈øe to be offended with it, as the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> at the two Tribes and an halfe for the new Altar: but when they expounded it to bein token, not in taking away of Gods Altar, they were not onely
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3808:178"/>pacified, but pray≈øed God for his goodne≈ø≈øe therein: So the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme, though it come neere a ≈øigne in Bapti≈øme, and may at the fir≈øt blu≈øh make vs feare with <hi>I≈ørael</hi> the <hi>revenge of the iniqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

It is therefore by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Church, no ≈øigne ≈øealing grace: but as that Altar, <hi>Io≈øh.</hi> 22.27. was a witne≈ø≈øe betwixt party and party; ≈øo this betwixt the Childe and the Congregation; for the Mini≈øter baptizing in the name of the Trinitie, ≈øayes <hi>I baptize:</hi> but in that action the phra≈øe is altered; and hee ≈øayes in the name of the Congregation <hi>wee receiue,</hi> ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as God by Bapti≈øme admits the Childe into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip with him≈øelfe: ≈øo they the Infant into the ≈øame communion of the Cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt with them≈øelues, that is, they gladly te≈øtifie, that they are not a≈øhamed of any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominies, or reproches for their Saviours ≈øake. And I would to God, that ≈øo Chri≈øtian an expo≈øition could ≈øtay our brethren for going vp again≈øt vs in Battell. A ≈øecond Que≈øtion may be, whether Chri≈øt as man may be pictured? I an≈øwere; that ≈øubiect that is to be adored, is not to be painted; for it can no wayes be ≈øet forth as civill, and ≈øo wee cannot haue an image of Chri≈øt (as he is to be adored) for civill or hi≈øtoricall v≈øe. Wee are flatly forbidden the very making of an image of God, and whole Chri≈øt being to be adored as God, we are not onely forbidden to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip his image, but al≈øo to make it. If any by the ≈øubtiltie of their wits can ab≈øtract Chri≈øts man hood from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or wor≈øhip from either of them both, I ≈øhall not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the keeping of an image of Chri≈øt, as of the greate≈øt Benefactor that ever came into the world: but my braine is too dull to devide in this ca≈øe; and therefore from the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3808:178"/>precept, <hi>Than ≈øhalt not make,</hi> that is, of the proper ≈øubiect of Religion, ≈øuch as was expre≈ø≈øed in the fir≈øt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any image. If it were of Religion it ≈øelfe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept could not be ≈øo generall; for the making of an image of God is morally a ≈øinne, I meane, in the very nature of the thing it ≈øelfe, and admits no di≈øpen≈øation, nay, God him≈øelfe, though he tooke libertie in his wor≈øhip to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe it by images; yet never did fie goe about to paint out him≈øelfe in any ≈øimilitude. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Yee heard the voyee of words, but ≈øaw no ≈øimilitude, onely yee heard a voyce;</hi> this is the way to ≈øhew his nature, which no other image can doe. And therefore I may conclude, that Chri≈øt as he is to be adored, ≈øo he is not to be painted, &amp;c. The third que≈øtion is, whether things indifferent, abu≈øed, may againe be v≈øed in the wor≈øhip of God, e≈øpecially, if their fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution haue beene ≈øuper≈øtitious? I an≈øwere; they may. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6.25.26. <hi>Baals bullock with Baals wood</hi> is ≈øacrificed to God by <hi>Gideon.</hi> His Altar is throwne downe, fir≈øt will God haue him cut the very throat of Idolatry, and when once Gods dete≈øtation, and their danger is cea≈øed, then may the good creatures of God, prophened to Idolatry, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to the holy ≈øervice of their makes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.6. The fixe water pots were ≈øuper≈øtitiou≈øly abu≈øed, for private pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, whereas God had onely inioyned it for the Temple: yet our Sauiour v≈øed both the pots and water, ≈øee the holy working of a miracle, &amp;c. yet this rule mu≈øt ever be ob≈øerued, that things indifferent when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ≈øcandalous and offen≈øiue, are to be foreborne. The Iewi≈øh Ceremonies were retained in the Church of God as things in different after the di≈ø≈øolution of their nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry v≈øe. But when they became hurtfull and offen≈øiue to Gods Church, they were reiected by the Apo≈øtles. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes the≈øe foure propo≈øitions ≈øhould quiet any man, con≈øcience in this ≈øubiect, which hath in all times cau≈øed ≈øuch trouble to Gods Church. Fir≈øt, that the Church of God hath power to retaine things indifferent. Secondly, that the ≈øame Church (as it ought) hath power to remoue
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3808:179"/>them when they proue ≈øcand aloua and offen≈øiue. Thirdly, that this power is to be exerci≈øed by our Governours, and not by private men. Fourthly, that private men ≈øinne not in the retaining of them, they cannot be taxed, or touched with that which is none of theirs; for God requires refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of none, but ≈øuch as haue receiued iniunctions from him.</p>

All the dayes are his, who gaue time a beginning &amp; continuance; yet ≈øome he hath made ours, not to command, but to v≈øe.

               <p>A. The third Commandement. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, &amp;c.</hi> By name we are to vnder≈øtand any thing by which Almightie God is made knowne vnto vs, as his nature, attributes, word, and workes.</p>

The <hi>Iewes</hi> haue a conceit, that the ≈øinne of that <hi>I≈øraelite</hi> which was ≈øtoned for bla≈øphemy, was onely this, that he named that ineffable name of foure letters, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Shall their feare keepe them from once

               <p>Q. <hi>What is the law of our diligent learning to wor≈øhip God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The fourth Commandement. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. S. 9.10.11. Remember the Sabboth day to keepe it holy.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is here commanded?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The ≈øetting apart of the ≈øeventh day to the ≈øervice of God, as like wife all diligence in learning to know his will. He that will needs be his owne Scholler, hath commonly a foole to his Ma≈øter. It is dangerous medling with the things of God according to our owne appoiatments. How perplext, and in how manifolde mindes are men, as tho≈øe that are encountred with diver≈øe wayes, and know not which to take, in this poynt of the Sabboth? It ≈øhall be well, if ≈øome change not their ma≈øter, as they ≈øeeme to haue changed their livery in their ≈øervice on this day. All our thoughts and vitall ≈øpirits are too little in remembring the ≈øanctification of it. True it is that the ≈øub≈øtance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both con≈øi≈øteth not in houres, but in holine≈ø≈øe, not in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall day, but the ≈øanctification of it; and therefore the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the time, is no mutation, or change in the e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the fourth Commandement, but onely in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of it. Time, as other naturall things, is ≈øeparate and ≈øet apart for holy v≈øe. All time is Gods by creation, and waites vpon the creature, and his actions: but the ≈øeventh part of time is to be his by the holy ob≈øervation of it. And here a iourney to <hi>Dama≈øcus</hi> were happily vnder-taken, to meet with ≈øome good <hi>Annanias,</hi> that might cau≈øe to fall tho≈øe <hi>≈øcales</hi> of ignorance, where with wee are blinded in a fallacie of <hi>compo≈øition</hi> and <hi>divi≈øion;</hi> thinking the Sabboth to be abrogated, becau≈øe the time is changed from a ≈øeventh day to a fir≈øt day. <hi>Truth is great and prevaileth;</hi> for I ≈øee no
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3808:180"/>greater change in this, then if the Sacrament ≈øhould bee celebrated with one kinde of water, or bread, and not with another. For naturall things in both are elevated aboue them≈øelues to ≈øupernaturall ends. Time therefore is as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in the fourth Commandement, as bread, wine, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evangelicall in the Sacraments. Fir≈øt, the <hi>di≈øtribution</hi> of time proues the ≈øeventh part con≈øecrated to God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.9. And let him take heed that ≈øacrilegiou≈øly ≈øleales it from God. I am re≈øolved (like Surgeans and Phy≈øitians) rather to force a bitter pill, or ≈ømarting ≈øalue, then ≈øuffer a patient to peri≈øh. With what face can≈øt thou ≈øay (O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Soule) not <hi>≈øixe dayes</hi> will I labour, but al≈øo play and plea≈øe my ≈øelfe vpon the <hi>≈øeventh?</hi> Secondly, the order and ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of parts, will proue, either the fir≈øt, or ≈øeventh part of time to be Gods. The whole is ≈øeven, and of the≈øe God mu≈øt haue a part, and if it be neither the fir≈øt nor the la≈øt, it will be in two weekes; for either from the fir≈øt to the la≈øt is a ≈øeventh day, or from the la≈øt to the fir≈øt: and therefore as the <hi>Logicke</hi> in the di≈øtribution, ≈øo the <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> in the number, proues Gods vncontroulable wi≈øedome in the removall of the Sabboth from the la≈øt member to the fir≈øt. Divines call (or rather mi≈øcall) the Sabboth, the eight day; for eight is no part of ≈øeven: onely in ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion of time the next day after the ≈øeventh is the eight, but this is not con≈øiderable in the precept: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands one of ≈øeven, and not one of eight. Thirdly, the end of this ≈øeparation is holine≈ø≈øe, and re≈øt: that a part of our time ≈øhould ≈øolemnly be imployed for the ≈øanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole, is as rea≈øonable as the authour, who doth all things in waight and mea≈øure. Againe, by holine≈ø≈øe wee are to enter into our perpetuall re≈øt; and therefore it is requi≈øite, that a part of time ≈øhould be a Sabboth here, becau≈øe wee looke for an everla≈øting Sabboth hereafter, and that all our time ≈øhall be turned into an holy re≈øt, from ≈øinne and ≈øorrow. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. As God the Father re≈øted after his workes of creation, and commanded the creature to imitate him therein: ≈øo God the Sonne after his workes
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3808:180"/>of Redemption, fini≈øhed in his humiliation, re≈øted in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And <hi>Dauid</hi> tells vs, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 118.24. that even Chri≈øt being refu≈øed in his humiliation, and made the head ≈øtone of the corner in his exaltation, brought to pa≈ø≈øe a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous worke in our eyes, and thereupon concludes, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made: wee will retoyce and be glad in it.</hi> This day of Chri≈øts re≈øurrection excells all other, and ≈øo is iu≈øtly our Sabboth, and kept by vs as a pledge of our re≈øurrection, and entrance into glory. Fourthly, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer is fayd <hi>to ≈øpeake all the≈øe words,</hi> Exod. 20.1. <hi>Even the≈øe ten words.</hi> Deut. 4.13. and therefore let them looke to it that dare make them nine. Good Surgeans and Phy≈øitians loue their patients, when they are cruell to their di≈øea≈øes. I cannot but count it a damnable errour, to detract one word from ten. They were all giuen equally in fire, and in fire ≈øhall equally be required. They were all written in tables of ≈øtone, becau≈øe they were fir≈øt written in the tables of our hearts, which as then lo≈øt all, like letters written in water, and are now as hard to receiue againe, as the very ≈øtones: the ceremoniall Law was better remembred then the morall: and of all the moralls, this hath the <hi>memento,</hi> men naturally being mo≈øt oppo≈øite vnto it. Oft times that which wee know not through our ≈øloth, the ≈øame by teares is made knowne vnto vs. And an afflicted mind certainly findeth out a fault committed; and the guilt which ≈øhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth not in ≈øecuritie, ≈øhee clearely perceiueth being troubled. He that findes and feeles his owne dulne≈ø≈øe on this day, will judge the breach greater then of a ceremony. La≈øtly, holine≈ø≈øe is the ≈øub≈øtance of the precept; and that is as morall in the ≈øolemne wor≈øhip of God, as the hauing of a God, or wor≈øhipping of him with reverence. But if pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie could not prevaile, me thinkes policie ≈øhould, men needing no teachers to be negligent in their duties. To conclude the point, this fir≈øt day of the weeke is according to creation, for mea≈øure and manner. And that is from evening to evening, or from darkene≈ø≈øe to darkene≈ø≈øe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5.</p>

               <p>A. The imployment of the day to any other v≈øe, to the hinderance of any holy exerci≈øe. Pietie is no Ceremony, and in that we are as ≈øtrictly bound to the ob≈øervation of it as ever were the <hi>Iewes,</hi> wherein wee doe not Iudaize, but moralize in true holine≈ø≈øe. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 58.13.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That wee doe to them, as wee would they ≈øhould doe to vs.</hi> Mark. 12.31. Math. 7.12. The loue of man begins at our ≈øelues, and as we in loue are ready to doe all good to our ≈øelues, and prevent all hurt: ≈øo mu≈øt wee from the ≈øame fountaine, be in readine≈ø≈øe to helpe our neighbour: how ill doth any man de≈øerue to haue an Occan of mercy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him, that will not let one drop of it fall vpon his brother, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Where is this commanded?</hi>

               <p>A. As the former in the fir≈øt table; ≈øo this in the ≈øecond, and our loue of man, is the declaration of our loue of God. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>He that loueth not his brother, whom he hath ≈øeene, how can he loue God whom he never ≈øaw?</hi> The Devill, when he cannot bring a man, who hath knowne God, to confront and de≈øpi≈øe him directly, he entreth him with this politicke traine; fir≈øt, makes him bold to trample downe his image, and then at length brings him to de≈øpi≈øe God.</p>

Furthermore, be≈øide all this wee are commanded by this precept to be content with our owne e≈øtate, and reioyce at the pro≈øperitie of others, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all grudging and repining at their good and wel-fare. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.9. Too many thinke, there is no ≈øuch law that requires a man to bee ≈øo ≈øtrait laced, as not to dare to looke awry. <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> fume and chafe, and aske, what needs all this adoe, as if it were not enough to keepe the law in their hands, but their very thoughts mu≈øt be bound vp with it. The covetous man thinkes it no matter to be greazed in his fi≈øt with a bribe, to remit but a little of the rigor of a good con≈øcience. Well, here is a rule that layes things hard to our charge, that if wee re≈øi≈øt not the very fir≈øt motions to ≈øinne, wee make our ≈øelues guiltie before God, and lyable to his iu≈øt wrath, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HItherto of obedience to the Law; What is Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An≈øwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an affectionate mouing of God, with things agreeable to his will.</hi> Rom. 8.27, and 10.14. Iam. 1.5.6. and 4.3. 1 Ioh. 2.1. and 5.14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ought it to be performed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. With all comely ge≈øture, in re≈øpect of that mightie Maie≈øtie whom we moue, and our owne ba≈øene≈ø≈øe who doe moue, and that with ardent affection, according to the nature of the thing we moue for. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is Prayer diflingui≈øhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is either <hi>mentall,</hi> or <hi>vocall;</hi> for the Lord vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands the language of the heart, as well as of the tongue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is mentall Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is a moving of God without a voyce, with the inward affections of the heart and ≈øoule. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> cryed to God when he ≈øpake never a word, and hereupon our ≈øighes, ≈øobbes, and groanes are good pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Nay, it is fit that the heart ≈øhould pray a long time before the mouth: full ve≈ø≈øels doe not pre≈øently run at the fir≈øt piercing, neither doth the fle≈øh that is deepely wounded, bleed pre≈øently: the heart that is truely touched with ≈øinne and mi≈øery, is not able vpon the ≈øudden to vent it ≈øelfe; for; as great throngs of people, pre≈ø≈øing out at ≈øome narrow pa≈ø≈øage, ≈øticke fa≈øt, and cannot goe forward but very ≈ølowly: ≈øo the abundance of matter in the heart, wanting words, is ≈øtreighted in comming forth, and often
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3808:183"/>a broken heart, di≈øchargeth it ≈øelfe in broken prayers. And yet the harmony of ≈øuch prayers is mo≈øt ≈øweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant to God; nay, ≈øometimes contraries, as the interlacing of di≈øcords, graceth this mu≈øicke.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is vecall Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. When according to the nature of the thing we moue for, wee labour to expre≈ø≈øe our ≈øelues in words, that the tongue may be the true interpreter of our prayers, and that the breath in which they are vttered, <hi>like pillars of ≈ømoaks perfumed with Myrrh and Incen≈øe, and with all the chiefe ≈øpices. Cant.</hi> 3.6. may come vp before God, as the prayers and almes of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Act. 10.4. Otherwi≈øe our words will be but like the <hi>Aegyptian flc≈øh pots,</hi> reeking out the hot va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the ≈øtrong ≈ømelling Onions and Garlike of our owne corruptions. If our prayers be not mentall before they be vocall, they ≈øpeed not: <hi>Ezekias</hi> 2 King. 19.4. bids <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> lift vp his prayer to God, that is, pray heartily. Lu≈øly beggars that flouri≈øh in their Rhetoricke, moue ≈ømall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion in the pa≈ø≈øenger; if they were hunger bitten, their hearts would teach them another dialect. The guilty theefe pleading for his life, goes not about to entertaine the Iudges eares with quaint phra≈øes, and fine words, but hee ≈øtudies to ≈øhew the pa≈ø≈øion and affection of his heart. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eloquence ≈øhews ≈ømall repentance; and affectation of Rhetoricke, is without all affection in prayer. Too many ≈øavour in their words more like the golden ≈øockets of the holy lights, blazing in ≈øpeculations, then the bowles of the Altar full of the liquor of heauenly devotion. Such haue more words then matter in their prayers: but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ≈øuters haue more matter then words, &amp; ever de≈øire to fit thier words according to their matter. This makes the heart like the pots in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20. ≈øend vp ≈øweet fumes of contrition, righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, thanke≈øgiuing, into the no≈øtrils of God, that he may ≈ømell a ≈øavour of re≈øt from vs; wee a ≈øavour of peace and life from him. That which was ≈øaid of <hi>Maries</hi> Spicknard, wherewith ≈øhe anointed Chri≈øt, that the whole Hou≈øe was filled with the ≈øavour of the oyntment.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:3808:184"/>Ioh. 12.3. The ≈øame may be ≈øaid of the≈øe plea≈øant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of our religious prayers, that they are fragrant to God and men: and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe Chri≈øt by a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, lyes as a bundle of <hi>Myrrh</hi> betweene the brea≈øts of euery Chri≈øtian, and that he him≈øelfe in regard of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods ≈øpirit is as an Orchard. <hi>Can.</hi> 4.13. of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, with plea≈øant fruits, as Cypres, Spicknard, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, &amp;c. and all the chiefe Spices of the Marchant. And in this ≈øen≈øe, the voyce of the Church is mo≈øt ≈øweet in prayer. <hi>Can.</hi> 2.14. On the contrary, if our hearts be like <hi>Ezechiels</hi> bloudy pots. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.6. that <hi>boile with the ≈øcum and ru≈øt of lu≈øt,</hi> revenge, ambition, wanton pampering of the fle≈øh in painted faces, prodigall gari≈øhne≈ø≈øe, mon≈øtrous di≈øgui≈øedne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. bringing in all exce≈ø≈øe in our re≈øpects to our ≈øelues, and content with all defects in our re≈øpects to God, wee may well ≈øay, <hi>death is in ≈øuch a pot,</hi> and that the ≈øacrifice thereof is more noy≈øome to God then any caryon. Never did the fiue Cities of the plaines ≈øend vp ≈øuch poy≈øonous vapours to God, as the prayers of a corrupt and polluted per≈øon, and God being not able to abide the≈øe ill ≈øents, ≈øends downe vpon ≈øuch, a counter-poy≈øon of fire and brim≈øtone. Oh, then let not this pot of the heart that ≈øhould boile the≈øe ≈øweet ≈øacrifices of prayer, either be dry for want of the liquor of grace, or grow ru≈øty for want of daily v≈øe, but let them be full of liquor and meat; ≈øo the fle≈øh-pots of the≈øe ≈øacrifices, <hi>erunt ≈øicut aromata,</hi> ≈øhall be as perfumes in the bowles of incen≈øe. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20. I know ≈øome are very ≈øhort in prayer for want of matter and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: but this will make vs ≈øhort and pithy for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of matter and affection. Prayer con≈øi≈øts not more in <hi>fragore quam fervore,</hi> more in contention of voyce, then in intention of heart.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is vocall prayer di≈øtingui≈øhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is either in <hi>pro≈øe,</hi> or <hi>meeter,</hi> ≈øung, or ≈øaid: And hereupon it followes, that the Liturgie of the Church may be not onely in ≈øet forme of prayers, but al≈øo in dimen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words, for <hi>meeter</hi> is the mea≈øure of words and ≈øylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3808:184"/>Let therefore the doting &amp; dizie headed Browni≈øts, either confe≈ø≈øe <hi>P≈øalmes, hymnes,</hi> and <hi>≈øpirituall ≈øongs</hi> to be no parts of divine wor≈øhip, or el≈øe that prayer may be in a ≈øet forme: but they can on the ≈øudden both ≈øing and ≈øay; yet in their dotage they haue taken paines to bring <hi>Davids</hi> P≈øalmes into an Engli≈øh meeter, and v≈øe them when they meet, notwith≈øtanding, they reiect their owne practi≈øe, and will not pray in any ≈øet forme of words, as if ≈øinging as well as ≈øaying, were not praying. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.19. But our ca≈øe is never the wor≈øe, for that the Lords prayer beares part with vs in this baffling of theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How mu≈øt all the≈øe be done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Seriou≈øly in the ≈øpirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.16. It mu≈øt be done <hi>with grace in our hearts to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is vocall prayer, deliuered either in pro≈øe or meeter, di≈øtingui≈øhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is either <hi>publicke,</hi> or <hi>private;</hi> In the Church, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, or Chamber. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2.9. <hi>and</hi> 14.23. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.11.12.13.14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is publicke Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That which is performed to God in the publicke place of his wor≈øhip, and in the publicke meeting of the Congregation; where the Pa≈øtour is to goe before in a liuely voyce, and the people to follow after in minde and heart; and in the conclu≈øion, to ≈øay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to te≈øtifie their con≈øent, and de≈øire to be heard. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.14. to the end.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is private Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is euery where, and in all places, and at all times, where either more are gathered together, and then one is to goe before, and the re≈øt follow in con≈øent as before; or el≈øe one by him≈øelfe alone, which may pray only in mind, or al≈øo with his voyce; and this againe may be more ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and accu≈øtomed, or a ≈øhort ejaculation, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Ion.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>To whom are wee to pray?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To the Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit, and to them alone. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Wee are onely to call vpon
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3808:185"/>them, in whom wee are to beleeue,</hi> and that is onely in God. I beleeue in God, not in any creature, for that is bla≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Neither is there in all the prayers of the Bible any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned, to whom wee are to ≈øue but God alone. If any ≈øhall demand, whether he may direct his prayer to one per≈øon of three; the an≈øwere is, he may doe it ≈øafely, and with comfort. What need we feare, while we haue our Sauiour for our patterne: <hi>Oh, my Father, if it be po≈ø≈øible, let this cup pa≈ø≈øe.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> euery where, both in thankes and reque≈øts, <hi>bowes the knees to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> yet mu≈øt this be done with due care of wor≈øhipping all in one. Exclude the other, while we fixe our heares vpon one, our prayers will be ≈øinne; retaine all and mention one, wee offend not. None of them doth ought for vs, without all. It is a true rule of Divines, all their externall workes are common: to ≈øollicite one therefore and not all, were iniurious.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Hitherto of Prayers generall affections; What are the kinds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Prayer is either <hi>≈øimple,</hi> or <hi>compound.</hi> Sometimes we are all ≈øuites vnto God, another time all thankes; and ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe wee ioyne all together. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whas is ≈øimple Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Where Prayer is of one nature onely. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed be God.</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Grace be to you, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How manifold?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is either Petition, or thanke≈øgiuing. Either wee reque≈øt ≈øome thing at Gods hands, or ble≈ø≈øe him for the receipt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. When by prayer we craue any thing of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What may fall out here≈øometimes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Making of <hi>vowes,</hi> which is a ≈øolemne promi≈øe made to God, with mature deliberation of things lawfull, and po≈ø≈øible, &amp;c. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 76.11.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many ≈øorts of Petitions are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; either a crauing of ≈øome things to be done
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3808:185"/>for vs, or an entreating that ≈øome thing may be avoyded by vs, or remoued from vs. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the crauing of ≈øomething to be done for vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Our petitions to God, to be≈øtow good ble≈ø≈øings vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; where we are to labour to haue a true ≈øen≈øe of the want of the≈øe ble≈ø≈øings. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.17.18.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein con≈øi≈øts it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Either in good things that concerne God, or our ≈øelues: the fir≈øt wee mu≈øt de≈øire infinitely, as the end of our thoughts, the other, with moderation, as meanes to helpe vs to that good. No man de≈øires <hi>meate,</hi> or <hi>medicine</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, but for health, wee never thinke wee haue enough of it: ≈øo God and his goodne≈ø≈øe mu≈øt be ≈øought without mea≈øure, but the things of this life in a meane, as meanes of a better kingdome. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What concerning God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Our <hi>≈øanctification</hi> of his name, the comming of his kingdome, and performance of his will: fir≈øt, wee pray that God may be glorified by vs; and ≈øecondly, wee pray that the meanes of his glory may be ≈øanctified vnto vs. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9.10.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What concerning Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. All things convenient and nece≈ø≈øary for him in his condition, that both him≈øelfe may line by Gods ble≈ø≈øing, and others by him, &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the things we intreat to be remoued from vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>mi≈øery:</hi> Where we are to make v≈øe of that holy exerci≈øe of <hi>fa≈øting,</hi> which is to ab≈øtaine from Gods creatures for a time, to te≈øtifie our humiliation before his Maie≈øtie. <hi>Iocl.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is our deprecation for the pardon of our ≈øinne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is our intreating of God to forgiue them, and that he will never lay them to our charge; Remi≈ø≈øion is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God the Father, whereby for the merites of his Sonne applied by his ≈øpirit, he accounts ≈øinne as no ≈øinne, or, as if it had never beene committed, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 38.17 <hi>and</hi> 44.22.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3808:186"/>
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>and</hi> 50.20. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈ø.</hi> 1.14 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is our deprecation in regard of mi≈øeries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That the Lord would deliuer vs out of all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other afflictions and calamities, which if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider them as they are ≈øent of God, then our entreating is in <hi>Lamentation;</hi> if as they are inflicted by the wicked. It is a <hi>Complaint.</hi> P≈øal. 35. and 69. In both which P≈øalmes, <hi>Dauid</hi> lamenteth for the wicked and complaineth of their ingratitude to God. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.19.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is thanke≈øgiuing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. An heartie acknowied gement of Gods mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed on vs, yeelding him due prai≈øe, and a≈øcribing vnto him, <hi>kingdome, power, and glory for ever, Amen.</hi> P≈øal. 29.2.9. and 66.2.3. and 96.6.7. Luk. 1.68. Eph. 1.3. Col. 3.17. 1 Tim. 2.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is a compound Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. A prayer con≈øi≈øting of all, or ≈øome of the≈øe ≈øimples. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I exhort, that ≈øupplications, prayers, interce≈ø≈øions, and giuing of thankes be made for all men.</hi> As faith is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit cocke, that watereth all the herbes and flowers that grow in the Garden of obedience; ≈øo prayer is the me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenger that knockes at heauen gates, for the ≈øhowers and dewes of heauenly benediction, to make all thriue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øper. Oh, that euery ≈øoule whiles it is fea≈øting and banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God by faith, as <hi>E≈øter</hi> with <hi>Aha≈øuero≈øh,</hi> could bethinke it ≈øelfe, what ≈øuites it hath to him, or what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øome enemie it would be rid off, ≈øuppo≈øe it to be ≈øome potent <hi>Haman</hi> of pride, &amp;c. How ≈øoone ≈øhould it be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and crucified before our eyes, if wee could but make our complaint to our be≈øt beloued? or if wee find we haue more need to petition for our≈øelues, then deprecate again≈øt others, then let vs duely con≈øider what grace wee want, ana make our ≈øuite to God, as <hi>Ach≈øah</hi> to <hi>Caleb, and wee ≈øhall haue giuen vs the plentifull ≈øprings of grace, both aboue and beneath.</hi> And that we may doe all the≈øe, the Lord powere

               <p>
                  <hi>An act of faith, whereby according to Gods in≈øtitution, wee celebrate the Sacraments or dained of God by the reciprocall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of godly giuing and taking.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23.24.25.26. Hence the Lords Supper is called a Communion, God communicating to vs by giuing, wee with him by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is a Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is a divine te≈øtimony, wherein externall ≈øen≈øible things, by a ≈øolemne right, are ≈øeparated from common v≈øe, to ≈øignifie, ≈øeale, and repre≈øent vnto the faithfull, a≈ø≈øurance of life in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus.</hi> Rom. 4.11. Circumci≈øion is ≈øayd to be a <hi>≈øigne and ≈øeale of righteou≈øue≈ø≈øe by faith.</hi> A ≈øigne in regard of the thing fignified, a ≈øeale in regard of the covenant made betwixt God and man; of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe not our owne, but that of Chri≈øt, both actiue and pa≈ø≈øiue; for all the wayes of God are iu≈øt and true, and therefore no imperfect righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe can be ≈øealed in Gods contracts, and treaties with men by faith, for that as the in≈øtrument makes the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt ours by imputation.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:3808:187"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many parts, or members be there in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; <hi>The outward and ≈øen≈øible ≈øigne, and the inward and ≈øpirituall grace;</hi> for as man con≈øi≈øts of a body and ≈øoule, and that nothing ordinarily comes to the ≈øoule but by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Almightie God conde≈øcending to our weakne≈ø≈øe, hath ordained outward teachers, to convey knowledge and comfort to the inward man. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> If bread, and the body of Chri≈øtwere not two di≈øtinct parts of a Sacrament, the Sacrament it ≈øelfe ≈øhould be lame and imperfect, both in rea≈øon and religion: In rea≈øon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the relation betwixt the ≈øigne and the thing ≈øignified ≈øhould be taken away, the one being pre≈øent without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a reall pre≈øence of fle≈øh, without a reall pre≈øence of bread; and ≈øo the teacher of the outward man being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, God is ≈øo farre in the Sacrament aboue our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, that it is incredible to beleeue either the thing, or the power of God in ≈øuch a conver≈øion; for it were vnrea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to turne a peece of bread into a glorified body, or a glorified body into an omni-pre≈øent God. A Sacrament is the plaine≈øt part of Divinitie, and commeth lowe≈øt both to our nece≈ø≈øitie and capacitie: yet Papi≈øts elevateit aboue all Divinitie, and make it ob≈øcure aboue mea≈øure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is again≈øt rea≈øon in proper ≈øpeech to call a member the whole, and to ≈øay the body of Chri≈øt is the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and perfect Sacrament. If they ≈øay it is but a part, then let them ≈øhew vs the other, the bread being vani≈øhed away, and remaining no more in his ≈øub≈øtance. Thirdly, it is again≈øt Divinitie and Religion, to thinke any part of it to be corporall food; for it is the rule of the will, and con≈øequently of the whole man; and ≈øo is a ≈øpirituall tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, though it be helped by ≈øen≈øible meanes to convey it ≈øelfe into the ≈øoule, and therefore Chri≈øt in the Sacrament profiteth not, except he be eaten by faith. A reprobate may receiue bread; but the ≈øigne, ≈øeale, and thing ≈øignified are none of his; for he hath no experience of this my≈øtery, that wants the fir≈øt part of Divinitie; without the which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3808:187"/>the ≈øecond cannot worke, no more then a man liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ≈øoule.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øen≈øible ≈øigne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That externall part, which is lyable to the ≈øen≈øes, whereby our faith being weake, and our ≈øanctification but in part, our che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience very imperfect, and prayers, not as they ≈øhould be; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the divine Goodne≈ø≈øe witne≈ø≈øeth to our ≈øen≈øes, the con≈øtancie of his purpo≈øe to ≈øaue vs, and it is (as it were) the badge, ≈øymbole, and token, whereby the true Church is married to the ≈øpou≈øe Ie≈øus Chri≈øt; and therefore ≈øeparated from all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and hence it is, to ≈øhew, to whom ≈øhe belongeth, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh her from all other ≈øects.</hi> Ho≈ø. 2.19.20. Math. 28.19. Act. 8.36.37. 1 Cor. 10.17.18.19.20.21.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Haue the≈øe ≈øignes beene alwayes the ≈øame?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; They haue beene diver≈øe, accerding to the times of Chri≈øt, either as he was to be exhibited, and then they were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and extraordinary; or el≈øe as he as exhibited in our fle≈øh.</hi> Before his comming, he confirmed the ordinary ≈øignes by extraordinary miracles, lea≈øt the <hi>Iewes</hi> ≈øhould doubt of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øias,</hi> or of the vertue of ≈øuch externall rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. The <hi>Cloud, Pillar of fire, Manna, Rccke, Red ≈øea, &amp;c.</hi> were all Sacramentall ≈øignes to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as well as Circumci≈øion, and the Pa≈ø≈øeover. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2.3.4.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øpirituall part?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, both God and man, with all his benefits, which hath never varied.</hi> Heb. 13.8. The Cup, and the Bread 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. are called, a Communion, that is, the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wine in the Cup, and eating of the bread, makes a communion betwixt vs and them in corporall nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So Chri≈øt with all his benefits, being receiued, and the fruit thereof being truly perceiued by faith, is our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3808:188"/>communion with the body &amp; bloud of Chri≈øt: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe wee communicate no more with Chri≈øt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then we doe with the bread and wine, whiles they ≈øtand vntouched vpon the Communion Table.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many Sacraments are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Two; one of our <hi>Nativitie,</hi> and another of our <hi>education:</hi> our Chri≈øtianitie is ≈øealed vnto vs both in the birth, and growing of it; for as the application of Chri≈øt vnto vs, is both for our being in him, and ri≈øing with him: ≈øo the two ≈øeales thereof, are either for our grafting into Chri≈øt, or growing vp with him. Hence the fir≈øt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be called the ≈øymbole, or ≈øeale of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, or initiation in Gods Church: it is (as it were) our <hi>matriculation,</hi> &amp;c. The ≈øecond, is the Sacrament of our ≈øpirituall nouri≈øhment, and continuance therein. It hath beene an auncient cu≈øtome in the Church of God, to ≈øet the <hi>Font</hi> below in the Church, and the <hi>Table</hi> aboue, and thereupon haue called it the high Altar, not for to ≈øacrifice Chri≈øt vpon it with the Papi≈øts, but to remember that everla≈øting, and perpetuall ≈øacrifice he offered once for vs vpon the Altar of his Cro≈ø≈øe. This is a humane Ceremony, and not without edification, becau≈øe it carries with it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ≈øignification to both the Sacraments, and yet are the≈øe places, or in≈øtruments ≈øet vp in them no wayes Sacramentall, though profitably ≈øignificant. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. The Cup, in the Communion, is no more Sacramentall, then the Font in Bapti≈øme; and yet the Apo≈øtle ≈øayes, <hi>the Cup, which we ble≈ø≈øe, is it not the Communion, &amp;c?</hi> He makes an holy v≈øe of the Cup which containes the wine, and ≈øo may we of the Font which holds the water: yet mu≈øt we not thinke the Cup more holy then the wine, the Font then the water, or the table then the bread and wine, &amp;c. And therefore it is a ≈øinne in ≈øome ignorant people, that more reverence the high Altar, then the Sacrament it ≈øelfe, and thinke that the ≈øupplene≈ø≈øe of their knees, in bowing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3808:188"/>at, or before the Communion Table, ≈øhould be a maske to hide the ≈øtarkne≈ø≈øe and numbne≈ø≈øe of all the ioynrs of their Soules, in their ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the Commandement it ≈øelfe, in a ≈øpirituall eating and drinking at the ≈øame Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is therefore to be reverenced, becau≈øe it is the Table of ble≈ø≈øing ≈øo ≈øpirituall a banquet. For it is too well ≈øeene and knowne, that ≈øuper≈øtitious <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> and carnall Prote≈øtants, (for I ≈øpeake not of them that reverence the place for the my≈øteries them≈øelues (as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Cup for the Sacramentall wine) that their knees, which are <hi>Camell</hi> like in the common curte≈øie in Gods hou≈øe, are ioyntle≈ø≈øe and <hi>Elephant</hi> like, in the ≈øpeciall obedience vnto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to whom the hou≈øe and place is con≈øecrated.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Sacrament of our Nativitie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the Sacrament of our ingraffing into Chri≈øt; and therefore but once v≈øed of vs.</hi> For wee are but once borne Chri≈øtians, though wee haue daily v≈øe of nouri≈øhment, no grow vp in Chri≈øtianitie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the externall part thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Before Chri≈øt was exhibited in the ≈øle≈øh, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ≈øignes were the pa≈ø≈øing of the <hi>I≈øraclites through the red ≈øea,</hi> and the <hi>Cloud,</hi> that was by day to couer them, and the Pillar of fire by night to guide them in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe: the ordinary ≈øigne was the <hi>circumci≈øing</hi> and cutting of the foreskinne of the fle≈øh, but ≈øince Chri≈øts comming our Bapti≈øme, or wa≈øhing of the fle≈øh. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øpirituall meaning of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Chri≈øts righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe wa≈øhing away our ≈øinnes:</hi> ≈øecondly, <hi>the pre≈øenting of vs as holy, cleare, and cleane before the Father, whereby wee are deliuered from death, and re≈øtored againe to life.</hi> Eph. 5.26.27. Tit. 3.5.6.</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:3808:189"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Sacrament of our ≈øpirituall education?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is that Sacrament of our ≈øpirituall nouri≈øhment, or growing vp with Chri≈øt, after wee are once in him, and therefore this is more often to be performed by vs.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øen≈øible part thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Before Chri≈øt was exhibited, the extraordinary ≈øignes, were <hi>Manna,</hi> and the <hi>water</hi> which ranne from the <hi>Rocke;</hi> the ordinary was the <hi>Lambe</hi> in the Pa≈ø≈øeover. Since Chri≈øt was exhibited, the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.26.27.28. 1 Cor. 10.3.4.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ≈øpirituall meaning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our continuall ≈øtrengthening of the ≈øpirituall man by his often feeding (as it were) by faith vpon the Lord and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe, to the vndoubted a≈ø≈øurance of eternall life.</hi> Ioh. 6.32.33.35.50.51.54.55.56. &amp;c. Say not now (O carele≈ø≈øe Chri≈øtian) when thou ha≈øt runne over the≈øe rules, thy Catechi≈øme is done: but con≈øider it is not done, till thou ha≈øt done it. Thou maye≈øt be an vncleane bea≈øt for all thy chewing of the Cud, and frequent repeating of the≈øe le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, except thou devide the hoofe in holy practi≈øe. I haue endevoured to anoint thy right eare with whol≈øome advi≈øe, but labour thou to haue thy right thumbe and toe annointed with the holy oyle of grace, to walke more ≈ømoothly and currantly in the wayes of God. Remember thy Bapti≈øme, and entrance into the flood <hi>Iordan,</hi> not there like boyes, to play and paddle in ≈øo holy a water, but to wa≈øh and be cleane. And for the Lords Supper, bee not like the changeling, <hi>Luther</hi> mentioneth, that is ever ≈øuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, never batling: rather take Saint <hi>Peters</hi> advi≈øe. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new borne babes dr≈øire the ≈ømeere milke of the Word, that yee may grow thereby.</hi> The bottle and the Bible are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, if wee drinke not the liquor, it cannot cheare vs, and if wee eate not the little booke, concoct, and dige≈øt it,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:3808:189"/>what nutriment can it afford vnto our ≈øpirituall life? Let vs all in the feare of God, like <hi>Gedeons</hi> Souldiers, learne to be as able to carry in our hands the burning Lampes of godly life, as wee are with our mouthes to ≈øound the trumpets of Gods truths. I ≈øay not a word more, make the rule the rudder of thy life, and the fountaine of thy well-liuing, and then doe that which thou knowe≈øt to be good, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie art thou.
